you 're doomed . you 're going to have to have all your sex at women 's apartments . it 'll be like a permanent road trip . forget about the home bed advantage .
i was just in there . it 's embarrassing .

for that rent she 'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to .
thanks a lot . i 'll give it back to you in a week .
five thousand dollars ? she does n't have five thousand dollars .
of course you do .
yeah my wife could n't make it today . she 's got something with her mother who knows what 's going on with her . do n't let any one kid you it 's tough .

is that right ? i just threw away a lifetime of guilt free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in madison square garden . so please a little respect . for i am costanza lord of the idiots .
but suddenly a new contender has emerged
i did n't know you were such a bette midler fan .
yeah he once bumped into reverend yung sun moon .
so what ? somebody dropped an egg on my head as i went into my building last night .
i do n't see how i could perform sexually in a situation after something like that . i was completely emasculated . anyway it 's not the only reason .
all right . you want to know what one of her favorite expressions is ? happy pappy ?

a backup system ? we 're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working ? that 's not a system . that 's a complete breakdown of the system .
it 's not that i want to keep talking about it ? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum .
how am i going to do this ? i 'm engaged to this woman ? she does n't even like me . change the subject ? toilets were the subject . we do n't even share the same interests .
i want your honest opinion about something .

oh yes i am . mr . thomassoulo likes to play dirty . well there 's nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil .
so check out my view .

she probably gets that impression because you 're cool . you 're under control . like me . nothing wrong with that .
dad the hinges are all rusted here . that 's why the wind keeps blowing the door off .
you 're selling computers ?

she dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in brooklin to see one of her performances .
oh yeah sure accident right . she was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire . then for the rest of the show i 'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt . flies are landing on me . i 'm boiling i 'm fantasizing all the things i 'm going to say when i see her . and later finally backstage when i talk to her i 'm a groveling worm . what kind of chocolate was that ? do you throw any other foods ? '
ich bin ein sucker .
so the college cancelled the gig ?

hi .
divorce is very difficult . especially on a kid .
of course i 'm the result of my parents having stayed together so you never know .

well dr allenwood uh i was hoping to compile an admittedly rudimentary scrapbook of her life . something that betsy could have and hold onto .
likewise .
what ?
well i 'm sorry timmy but i do n't dip that way .
well you see what happened was the doctor the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt suffered an untimely stroke and lost the use of his right hand so obviously i was unable to get the death certificate . however i do have this .
not even close huh ?
you met her at the supermarket ? how did you do that ?
maybe i 'll go down to the track . put it all on a horse
the bank ? this is found money . i want to parlay it . i want to make a big score .

how could that piece of crap cost $NUM . NUM . ?
it 's not me . it 's the car .
how could it still smell after all that ?
listen . you 're beautiful . you 're intelligent . you 'll meet other girls

hate the drake .
who 's the drake ?
i have n't even met the fiancee . whatever .
you do n't know what that spot means to him . once he gets it he does n't go out for weeks .

have you seen the waitresses in there lately ? i never had so much coffee in my life .
it 's a coincidence .

i 'm sure you are .
maybe karen is faking .
so uh you feel okay about that whole thing what we do in there you 're generally okay with everything in there ?
it 's jerry 's fault .
it 's like a magic trick . sometimes i think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation .
ripe . boy this joe 's got some terrific fruit .

no julie julie do n't insult me . you know what difference does it make who pays for lunch . it 's totally meaningless .
did you happen to notice that julie handed the big salad to elaine ?
so did you enjoy your lunch ?
there is no problem . . . just a small miscommunication . whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad .
you know i think i could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house . it seems like fun to me . it does n't seem like a gender thing . i think i would like to play with dolls . what 's so terrible ?
a ha . we 're just friends .
. . . well it was a big salad . and what i would like to know is how does a person who has nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretenses ah ah ?
i 'm making it up .
she was n't flirting with you .
