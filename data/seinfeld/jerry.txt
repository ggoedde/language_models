see to me that button is in the worst possible spot . the second button literally makes or breaks the shirt look at it . it 's too high . it 's in no man 's land . you look like you live with your mother .

how could she not tell me where she was staying ?
laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes . it is y'know think about it . the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes . you know it 's dark there 's bubbles happening they 're all kinda dancing around in there shirt grabs the underwear c 'mon babe let 's go . you come by you open up the lid and they 'll socks are the most amazing article of clothing . they hate their lives they 're in the shoes with stinky feet the boring drawers . the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it . they knew a escape from the dryer . they plan it in the hamper the night before tomorrow the dryer i 'm going . you wait here . the dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall . he hopes you do n't see him and then he goes down the road . they get buttons sewn on their faces join a puppet show . so they 're showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains . is this a violent image to anybody ? bloodstains ? i mean come on you got a t shirt with bloodstains all over it maybe laundry is n't your biggest problem right now . you got to get the harpoon out your chest first .

if my father was moving this he 'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way . have you got your end ? your endo s got to come down first easy now drop it down drop it down your endo s got to come down . '
look it 's a very awkward situation . i do n't want to be presumptuous .
all right she said she could n't find a decent hotel room
yeah a decent hotel room would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place .
this is the signal ? thank you mr . signal . where were you yesterday ?
yeah .
this is a person i like it 's not how to score on spring break .
yeah okay . oh wait a second . oh i forgot to clean the bathroom .
now how could that be good ?
this is how you operate ?
let me just wipe the sink .
the dating world is not a fun world it 's a pressure world it 's a world of tension it 's a world of pain and you know if a woman comes over to my house i got to get that bathroom ready cause she needs things . women need equipment . i do n't know what they need . i know i do n't have it i know that you know what they need women seem to need a lot of cotton balls . this is the one i 'm always has been one of the amazing things to me i have no cotton balls we 're all human beings what is the story ? i 've never had one i never bought one i never needed one i 've never been in a situation when i thought to myself i could use a cotton ball right now . i can certainly get out of this mess . women need them and they do n't need one or two they need thousands of them they need bags they 're like peat moss bags have you ever seen these giant bags ? they 're huge and two days later they 're out they 're gone the the bag is empty where are the cotton balls ladies ? what are you doing with them ? the only time i ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket there 's two or three that look like they 've been through some horrible experience tortured interrogated i do n't know what happened to them . i once went out with a girl who 's left a little zip lock baggy of cotton balls over at my house . i do n't know what to do with them i took them out i put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds . i thought maybe the cockroaches would see it figure this is a dead town . let 's move on . the dating world is a world of pressure . let 's face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night . the only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you 'll end up naked at the end of it . you know ? well bill the boss thinks you 're the man for the position why do n't you strip down and meet some of the people you 'll be working with ?
would n't it be great if you could ask a woman what she 's thinking ?
you know instead i 'm like a detective . i got to pick up clues the whole thing is a murder investigation .
really ? how ?
uh huh .
right .
lip area .
hug is definitely good .
although what if it 's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching the hips are eight feet apart ?
you know how they do that ?
shake is bad but what if it 's the two hander ? the hand on the bottom the hand on the top the warm look in the eyes ?
right .
hey hey .
heeeey .
it 's good to see you .
this is my friend george .
this is laura .
i ca n't believe you 're here .
ooh yeah the bags sure .
now that was an interesting greeting did you notice that george ?
so uh what do you think ?
yeah it kind a motivates me to work on the road . so uh make yourself at home . so uh can i get you anything ? uuhhh bread water salad dressing ?
uh yeah i think i do .
uh no yeah go right ahead .
uh yeah yeah sure why do n't you stay ? yeah uhm what is your what is your schedule for tomorrow ? are you are you doing anything ?
really ? what would you like to do ?
yeah we could do that why not why not . i 'm just i 'm really glad you 're here .
yeah hello yes yes she is hold on . um it 's for you .
you 're engaged ?
you 're engaged ?
you 're engaged .
yeah .
me too .
i swear i have absolutely no idea what women are thinking . i do n't get it okay ? i i i admit i i 'm not getting the signals . i am not getting it . women they 're so subtle their little everything they do is subtle . men are not subtle we are obvious . women know what men want men know what men want what do we want ? we want women that 's it . it 's the only thing we know for sure it really is . we want women . how do we get them ? oh we do n't know bout that we do n't know . the next step after that we have no idea . this is why you see men honking car horns yelling from construction sites . these are the best ideas we 've had so far . the car horn honk is that a beauty ? have you seen men doing this ? what is this ? the man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks . e eeehh eehhh eehhh . this man is out of ideas . how does it ? e e e eeeehhhh . i do n't think she likes me . the amazing thing is that we still get women do n't we ? men i mean men are with women . you see men with women . how are men getting women many people wonder . let me tell you a little bit about our organization . wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now . now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene . that 's why i think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like where to meet men ? we 're here we are everywhere . we 're honking our horns to serve you better .
is that it ? got the cue tips got the mini umbrella something boring to read on the plane . that 's it . done .
i am the master packer .
what you must understand elaine packing is no different than leading men into battle . you 've got to know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon . from a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks .
yes .
all right sir . george ?
uh yeah the uh hot water takes a little while to come on . so the best thing to do is to turn it on do all your shopping you come back and take a shower .
there 's more . the refrigerator .
deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates . no meat no leftovers no butter . and i cannot overstate this no soft cheeses of any kind . is that clear ?
one more thing benes regarding sexual activity strictly prohibited but if you absolutely must do us all a big favour . do it in the tub .
yeah one sec .
i 'm not looking .
yeah what 's it like ?
how much ?
two bedrooms ? why do i need two bedrooms ? i got enough trouble maintaining activity in one . i saw that .
really ? why ?
ohhhh
like this ? you just said you wanted to live here .
i ca n't think about it now . come on i 'm going to minneapolis . i got four shows this weekend .
elaine . elaine .
great i had fun . where 's the tv where 's the vcr ?
what ?
stolen ? when ?
stolen ?
you left the door open ? .
wait you left the lock open or the door open ?
the door ? you left the door open ?
yeah and ?
so the door was wide open ?
and where were you ?
no .
because i spent my money on the clapgo d NUM . it 's the most impenetrable lock on the market today . it has only one design flaw . the door must be closed .
yeah do n't investigate do n't pay me back it was an accident .
in your way .
answering machine . oh i hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls .
it 's a joke .
you ever find anything ?
well thanks anyway .
the crook has the machine . the messages are n't for him . he 's the crook . why would he answer how did you get in here ?
again ?
you would still want to move in here ?
is that uh other apartment still available ?
i got ripped off for about the NUM time ? and now the first couple a times you go through it it 's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say call the police . you really should call the police . so you think to yourself you know you watch tv you think yeah i 'm calling the police . stakeouts manhunts i 'm going to see some real action . right you think that . so the police come over to your house they fill out the report . they give you your copy . now unless they give the crook his copy i do n't really think we 're going to crack this case do you ? it 's not like batman where there 's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows who they are . very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore . it makes them a lot tougher to spot . did you lose a sony ? it could be the penguin . i think we can round him up he 's dressed like a penguin . we can find him he 's a penguin .
how do you get all that wood in here ?
they deliver wood ?
what do you tip a wood guy ?
would i have to get a gardener ?
you tip him ?
they deliver the coal ?
oh then i got to tip him .
i do n't have any plants .
i like that . what do you think george ?
i 'm taking it i 'm taking the place . i 'm going to take it this is going to be my new place . i 'm living here i 'm moving .

so what ?
you did n't call no interference .
i do n't believe this .
i do n't want to win it like this . elaine what do you think ?
well i 'll tell you what . i 'll choose you for it . straight choose three takes it no disputes that 's it you got to win three .
odds .
good .
you got evens .
for the apartment .
mine .
mine .
thanks .
yeah .
hard to imagine .
right .
ooh case closed .
okay starting now .
one of the problems in life is that when you 're a kid you have a certain way of working out disagreements . and those laws do not work in the adult world . one of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it . one of them says i got the front seat i wanted the front seat . i called it . and the other kid knows he 's got nothing to say he called it . what can i do ? if there was a kid court of law it holds up . your honour my client did ask for the front seat and the judge would go did he call it ? well no he did n't call bang . he has to call it case closed . objection overruled . '
it 's a good mirror . so what are you gettin ?
all right forget it forget it . i 'm not taking the place .
how can i live there ?
look at you you 're still thinking about it . i 'll never feel comfortable .
how can i ever have you over ? you 'll sit there moping .
you 're already moping . would you take the place ?
you found the place .
all right forget it it 's over i 'm not moving .
definitely ?
alright then just get rid of it . you wo n't have any problem .
she wanted to thank us for the apartment .
if only the coin had n't hit the table .
it is not .
it 's wonderful .
how late are the stores open ? i 'm thinking of maybe uh buying a new tv and smash it over my head .
i do n't think you did anything wrong .
we can only thank god for that .
you 're imagining this . really .
what floss ? when ?
ah mint .
so let me get this straight . she saw the floss you panicked and you told her you liked her .
and you 're sure the floss was the catalyst ?
you do n't think it might 've had anything to do with that ?
it looks like your belt is digesting a small animal .
who is it ?
who is it ?
hello ? oh hi joel . no . uh i was out of town . i just got back . kramer does n't know anything . he 's just my next door neighbor . uh nothing much tuesday ? uh tuesday no . i 'm meeting somebody uh wednesday ? wednesday 's okay all right . uh i 'm a little busy right now . can we talk wednesday morning ? okay yeah right thanks bye . why did you put me on the phone with him ? i hate just being handed a phone .
maybe i did n't want to talk to him .
he bothers me . i do n't even answer the phone anymore because of him . he 's turned me into a screener . now i got to go see him on wednesday .
we 're going . that 's next wednesday .
his name is joel horneck . he lived like three houses down from me when i grew up . he had a ping pong table . we were friends . should i suffer the rest of my life because i like to play ping pong ? i was ten . i wouldo ve been friends with stalin if he had a ping pong table . he 's so self involved .
can you conduct your business elsewhere ?
i do n't bother with him . he 's been calling me for seven years . i 've never called him once . he 's got the attention span of a five year old . sometimes i sit there and i make up things just to see if he 's paying attention .
what can i do ? break up with him ? tell him i do n't think we 're right for each other . he 's a guy . at least with a woman there 's a precendent . you know the relationship goes sour you end it .
just break up with him ?
the truth .
as a guy i do n't know how i can break up with another guy . you know what i mean ? i do n't know how to say bill i feel i need to see other men . do you know what i mean ? there 's nothing i can do . i have to wait for someone to die . i think that 's the only way out of this relationship . it could be a long time . see the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing . just two guys will just become friends just because they 're two guys . that 's almost all we need to have in common . cause sports sports and women is really all we talk about . if there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is so what 's in the refrigerator ? '
you know i read the lenny bruce biography i thought it was really interesting . he would
so i 'm thinking about going to iran this summer .
anyway the hizballah has invited me to perform . you know it 's their annual terrorist luncheon .

yeah i 'll have the egg salad on whole wheat .
how can you talk to someone like that ?
listen joel . there 's something i have to tell you
listen joel i do n't think we should see each other anymore .
this friendship it 's not working .
we 're just not suited to be friends .
look you 're a nice guy it 's just that we do n't have anything in common .
y you did n't do anything . it 's not you it 's me . it 's this is very difficult .
no it 's not that .
oh come on . that 's not true .
i know i know .
best friend i 've never been to your apartment .

no i do not like the bank . i 've heard the expression laughing all the way to the bank . i have never seen anyone actually doing it . and those bank lines . i hate it when there 's nobody on the line at all you know that part you go to the bank it 's empty and you still have to go through the little maze . can you get a little piece of cheese for me ? i 'm almost at the front . i 'd like a reward for this please . '
george .
could you stop the counting ?
can i make it up to you ? i 'll give you fifty bucks for the jug .
well then i 'm not going to the game either . okay ? i 'll give him both tickets .
i no i do n't want to go .
i had to give him a tissue . in fact let me call his machine now and i 'll just make up some excuse why i ca n't go to the game either .
george the man wept .
i i have to say something . with all due respect i just never i ca n't imagine anyone in any walk of life under any circumstance wanting to make their own pizza pie but that 's me . alright
i 'm just saying alright .
okay .
hi joel . this is jerry . i hope you get this before you oh hi . joel oh you just came in listen i ca n't make it to the game tonight i uh have to tutor my nephew yeah he 's got an exam tomorrow geometry you know trapezoids rhombus anyway listen you take the tickets . they 're at the will call window and i 'm really sorry have a good time we 'll talk next week okay yeah i do n't fine fine bye .
i know . i 'm really running out of excuses with this guy . i need some kind of excuse rolodex .
okay .
where do you want to go ?
we could go to one of those uh cappuccino places . they let you just sit there .
we could talk .

okay just hand that over please .
it 's a list of excuses it 's for that guy horneck who 's at the game tonight with my tickets . i have that list now so in case he calls i just consult it and i do n't have to see him . i need it . what are you doing ?
i do n't need any more .
very funny .
i 'm dan . can i have my list back please ?
what can i do ?
oh no . that 's impossible . i 'd rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again . he was crying . tears . accompanied by mucus .
couple of tough monkeys .
game ?
wait . how does horneck know you ?
this is too much .
oh no .
perfect .
oh we finished early .
elaine benes this is joel horneck .
we 're still friends .
right . i forgot about choir .
right . you know the wall being down and everything .
you really should .
you know i really i 've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they 're just always your friends and you have to accept it . you see them you do n't really want to see them . you do n't call them they call you . you do n't call back they call again . the only way to get through talking with people that you do n't really have anything in common with is to pretend you 're hosting your own little talk show . this is what i do . you pretend there 's a little desk around you . the only problem with this is there 's no way you can say hey it 's been great having you on the show . we 're out of time . '
i think superman probably has a very good sense of humor .
but it 's common sense . he 's got super strength super speed . i 'm sure he 's got super humor .
why ? why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of earth ?
no problem .
were you crying ? i mean it 's just a grape . you 'll find it .
robert .
i 've been thinking about asking this girl i 'm uh seeing
vanessa thank you . i 've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days .
you better find that grape before it mutates into another life form . there was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the texas panhandle . they brought in the army nobody could stop it . apparently it had a pit of steel .
what stock ?
maybe .
how high 's it suppose to go ?
boy i do n't know .
what kind of company is it ?
well how much are you going to invest ?
boy
what if i lose it ?
all right . twenty five hundred .
my bet ? all right . i 'll open with a tuna sandwich .
oh the dolphin thing ?
ohhh you know the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna .
hey when i 'm driving i let people in ahead of me all the time . i 'm always waving everybody in . go ahead go ahead go ahead . all right . all right . i 'll have a chicken salad .
i have to say those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me .
what do you want me to do ? i gave the guy the half turn . then i gave him the full turn with the eye roll . i mean beyond that i 'm risking a punch in the mouth . excuse me do you have these in the puffs ?
you know my friend told me about this great place in vermont .
it 's great . it speeds up the intimacy level . it 's like putting the relationship in a time compressor . where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days .
exactly . i love phase two . extra toothbrushes increased phone call frequency walking around naked . you know the presents get a lot better in phase two .
yeah . we can fish . what ? blues carp marlin ?
oh big fighting marlin .
is that my paper ?
what ? what news ?
oh c 'mon . it 's down again ? .
oh i ca n't believe it . let me see that . that 's four and a half points in three days . that 's almost half my money .
yeah you told me .
there 's one thing i do n't understand . why does it please you ? george costanza please .
george what 's going on ? .
well where is the guy ? . nothing ? . almost half my money 's gone well call me right back . nobody can reach wilkinson . he has n't been home or in his office in the past three days .
roll out tie dispenser ? what was that one ?
okay
oh no .
you 're gone all right .
yeah i 'm going to vermont with uh vanessa for a few days .
what friends ?
george what ? . you 're kidding well what 's wrong ? so what are we going to do ? great . all right i 'll speak to you later . wilkinson the guy who 's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock he 's in the hospital .
so you do n't know what 's wrong with him ?
okay fine . has simons been in touch with him ?
well this is it . i 'm selling .
i never shouldo ve gotten involved in this . i 'm a nervous wreck . i 'm not cut out for investing .
where ?
the hospital ?
are you nuts ? you do n't even know the guy .
what if he 's in an iron lung or something ? what are you going to do ? how you feeling mr . wilkinson ? by the way what 's happening with sendrax ? '
who goes to the hospital to rest ?
okay fine fine . when are you going down there ?
all right .
yeah . i picked up this shirt here yesterday . it 's completely shrunk . there 's absolutely no way i can wear it .
what 's the difference ? look at it . do you see the size of this shirt ? .
i ca n't find the receipt .
look forget about the receipt all right ? even if i had the receipt look at it . it 's a hand puppet . what am i going to do with this ? .
what do you think this is a little scam i have ? i take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money ? in fact forget the money . i do n't even want the money . i just once i would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault . that 's what i want . i want an admission of guilt .
no . dry cleaned .
you shrunk it . you know you shrunk it . just tell me that you shrunk it .
i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner well it 's ruined . and of course the dry cleaner can respond it 's not our fault . we 're not responsible . we just ruin the clothes . that ends our legal obligation . you see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible . th right ? they 're cleaning our clothes but they 're not getting anything wet . it 's all dry . i know there 's got to be some liquids back there some fluids that they 're using . there 's no such thing as dry cleaning . when you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that that 's dry cleaning . i do n't think that 's what they 're doing back there . they do n't have eighty guys going come on hurry up . there 's a lot of shirts today . '
bless you .
well it could n't be too expensive . thirteen fourteen bucks a cat ?
i 'm no cat killer .
i 'd really like to go elaine . but george is coming back from the hospital . i got to wait for him . but otherwise i would definitely go .
yeah .
yeah he 's nuts . you wanta bump off a couple of cats . i know i know . it 's down again .
i do n't know fifteen hundred dollars .
you do n't have to say wow . i know it 's wow . and there 's that smile again . well what is that ? it 's george .
i really do n't need to look .
yeah and you 're just what she 's looking for too a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up .
what ? what ? did you go down there ? did he tell you what 's going to happen ? how long were you there ?
you told him you knew simons ?
well that 's it . look i 'm going to vermont . i do n't want to think about this . i 'm selling .
so i know this guy . i 'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now .
oh yeah right .
oh god . get me out of here . what a mistake . what made me think this would work ? and i 've still got another day . i 've got nothing left to say . wait wait got one . that 's a nice watch . do you wind it ?
well that 's good .
well the drive home should be a delight . i 'm speeding the whole way . let them throw me in jail . i do n't care . that 's the manager ? do you want me to see if we can get another room ?
so i guess you do n't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold charming ?
well what do you want to do this afternoon ?
we cold play sorry . we cold play steal the old man 's bundle . maybe i can get an extension cord and hang myself . what kind of perfume is that you 're wearing ?
no what ? what kind is it ?
yeah that 's normal . excuse me sir . could i have a look at that business section ?
i did . i 'm just curious . it 's been almost a week . i want to check it out . six points ? it 's up six points .
you did not tell me not to sell .
look vanessa of course the market fluctuates . everybody knows that . i just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars .
what ?
no what ? that 's probably why
so what am i looking at here ? twenty nine hours to go . well at least i got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume
she 's full . so big daddy . i 'm just curious . how much did you clear on your little transaction there all told ?
how much ?
so wilkinson 's out of the hospital now ?
is that still from the cats ?
so what ever happened with that ?
i got to say that 's pretty sad . losing out to a cat .
we went over that .
a robot butcher ?
i 'm not an investor . people always tell me you should have your money working for you . i 've decided i 'll do the work . i 'm going to let the money relax . you know what i mean ? cause you send your money out there working for you a lot of times it gets fired . you go back there what happened ? i had my money . it was here it was working for me . yeah i remember your money . showing up late . taking time off . we had to let him go . '
no of course not .
everyday .
you tried .
did you tell her you loved her ?
you 're a human being .
you 're too nice a guy .
you 're flesh and blood .
i told you when i met her .
you got to go to my chiropractor he 's the best .
i 'm going to make an appointment for you . we 'll go together .
you should just do it like a band aid . one motion . right off .
hi .
hello .
no shower . so where are we eating ?
a relationship is an organism . you created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you . same thing happened in the blob .
hello hello . is glen there ? i 'm sorry . is this NUM NUM NUM ? yes i know i have the wrong number but i just want to know if i dialed wrong or if
oh it 's you again . see now if you had answered me i would n't have had to do this . now that 's two long distance calls i made to you why ca n't you why ? why do they just hang up like that ? thank you very much .
no i just had a sandwich .
i do n't want cantaloupe now .
i only eat cantaloupe at certain times
all right .
it 's very good .
good .
uh huh .
it 's too far .
i 'm not pulling a shopping cart . what am i suppose to wear a kerchief ? put stockings on and roll em down below my knee ?
i do n't return fruit . fruit is a gamble . i know that going in .
you did it ? what happened ?
uh huh
see it 's never as bad as you imagine .
could you stop that smacking ?
it 's very good cantaloupe . so that 's it ? you 're out ?
so go get them .
so forget about the books . did you read them ?
what do you need them for ?
what is this obsession people have with books ? they put them in their houses like they 're trophies . what do you need it for after you read it ?
so you want me to get the books ? is that it ?
so what 'd you do ?
well i have a general idea what it was . i could take a guess .
no .
i do n't know how this happened .
no no . it 's not your fault . books books i need my books . have you re read those books yet by the way ? you know the great thing ? when you read moby dick the second time ahab and the whale become good friends . you know it 's not like marlene 's a bad person or anything but my god . i mean we 've had like three lunches and a movie and she never stops calling . and it 's these meaningless purposeless blather calls . she never asks if i 'm busy or anything . i just pick up the phone and she 's in the middle of a sentence .
ohh . you know and sometimes she 'll go hello jerry ? and i 'll go oh hi marlene . and then it 's jerry
ohhhh . you ca n't . it 's impossible . there 's no break in the conversation where you can go all right then you know it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall . i mean i got to put a stop to this .
yeah . yes she is .
the waiting room . i hate when they make you wait in the room . cause it says waiting room . there 's no chance of not waiting . cause they call it the waiting room they 're going to use it . they 've got it . it 's all set up for you to wait . and you sit there you know and you 've got your little magazine . you pretend you 're reading it but you 're really looking at the other people . you know you 're thinking about about them . things like i wonder what he 's got . as soon as she goes i 'm getting her magazine . and then they finally call you and it 's a very exciting moment . they finally call you and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room . well i guess i 've been chosen . i 'll see you all later . you know so you think you 're going to see the doctor but you 're not are you ? no . you 're going into the next waiting room the littler waiting room . but if they are you know doing some sort of medical thing to you you want to be in the smallest room that they have i think . you do n't wnat to be in the largest room that they have . you know what i mean ? you ever see these operating theaters that they have with like stadium seating ? you do n't want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go i have to see this . are you kidding ? are they really going to do that to him ? are there seats ? can we get in ? do they scalp tickets to these things ? i got two for the winslow tumor i got two
so how was it ?
well it 's a first visit .
you ca n't do that .
he 's a doctor . you got to pay what he says .
no i 'm fine .
yeah i know .
yeah .
good night .
hey .
uh huh .
that is out there .
no supermarket .
it 's uh okay .
i 'm not taking it back .
i do n't care about it .
all right . take it back .
marlene .
yeah i took her home one night we kinda started up a little bit in the car .
i was . but she 's got me like hypnotized .
no he 'd go nuts .
i feel terrible . i mean i 've seen her a couple of times since then and i know i ca n't go any further but she 's just got this like psychosexual hold over me . i just want her i ca n't breathe . it 's like a drug .
i do n't know how i 'm going to tell him .
it 's partially you yeah .
well he ca n't kill me right ?
i mean she called me . i have n't called her . she started it .
i 'm a nice guy .
oh my little airplane lamp .
well the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices because you do n't have to be home on time .
yeah because they would be very demanding people .
well you know what they say . lucky in love unlucky with fruit .
really ? that guy who stopped saying hello ?
you talked to him ?
right .
you said you little phony ?
this is amazing .
you are the queen of confrontation . you 're my new hero . in fact you 've inspired me . i 'm going to call george about something right now .
you 're kidding .
you mean that ?
you do n't care ?
how could you not care ?
i thought you 'd be upset .
am i a bad person ? did i do something terrible ?
that voice . that voice . she 's driving me crazy .
so i can see her tonight and you do n't care ?
all right . as long as you 're okay . because i ca n't stop thinking about her .
good . and i 'll tell you what you do n't have to pay me back the thirty five i gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill .
i had to .
it was embarrassing to me .
why do n't you make a point with your own doctor ? what 's wrong ?
so you want to come up for a few minutes ?
really ? i thought
gee i just did n't expect it from the way you 've been acting .
of course i want to talk about it .
tuesday night ? what happened tuesday night ?
my act ? wha what does that have to do with anything ?
i ca n't believe this . so what are you saying ? you did n't like my act so that 's it ?
you 're a cashier .
you ca n't go by the audience that night . it was late . they were terrible .
i have other stuff . y you should come see me on the weekend .
women need to like the job of the guy they 're with . if they do n't like the job they do n't like the guy . men know this . which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have . well right now i 'm the regional management supervisor . i 'm in development research consulting men on the other hand if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job . are we ? men do n't really care . men 'll just go really ? slaughterhouse ? is that where you work ? that sounds interesting . so whaddaya got a big cleaver there ? you 're just lopping their heads off ? that sounds great . listen why do n't you shower up and we 'll get some burgers and catch a movie . '
hi .
would you make this thing lower . i can hear it on the street .
we won . i made an incredible play in the field . there was a tag up at third base and i threw the guy out from left field on a fly . we 'll be in the championship game wednesday because of me . it was the single greatest moment in my life .
well no . sharon besser of course .
well the man 's an individualist he worked for harry flemming . he knows what he 's doing .
first of all i made plans with elaine .
i do n't even know them . what is she your second cousin ? i mean i 've met them three times in my life .
if i wind up sitting next to uncle leo i am leaving . he 's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me . i guess it 's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation .
yeah . he talks about him like he split the atom . the kid works for the parks department .
we won . we 're in the finals on wednesday .
what is this about ?
what are you doing ?
levels ?
you drew up plans for this ?
when do you intend to do this ?
you 're doing this yourself ?
oh no . it 's not that i do n't think you can . i know that you ca n't and i 'm positive that you wo n't .
i do n't see it happening .
seriously ?
i 'll give you a year .
it 's a bet .
seriously do you want to switch chairs ?
yeah uncle leo .
right . for the reducing of the pond scum ?
oh yeah . where the people eat the plant life . the edible foliage tour .
mickey mantle ?
these peas are bursting with country fresh flavor .
well actually we do have to kind of get going .
yeah i ca n't eat dessert either . the sugar makes my ankles swell up and i ca n't dance .
horses ? they 're like big riding dogs .
i know i hated those kids . in fact i hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up .
well i did n't uh really mean a pony per se
nothing . nothing at all . i was just merely expressing
well i 'm sure you did . who would n't love a pony ? who would n't love a person that had a pony ?
no see we did n't have ponies . i 'm sure at that time in poland they were very common . they were probably like compact cars
i did n't know she had a pony . how was i to know she had a pony ? who figures an immigrant 's going to have a pony ? do you know what the odds are on that ? i mean in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats coming into new york harbor i never saw one of them sitting on a pony . why would anybody come here if they had a pony ? who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non pony country ? it does n't make sense . am i wrong ?
i 'll drive you to the airport .
i just hope that whole pony incident did n't put a damper on the trip .
well if you ever talk to her tell her i 'm sorry . elaine too . she feels terrible .
maybe i will .
really ? what a shock .
take care .
bye dad . take it easy .
so when do i get my dinner ?
yes i know you 're not going to do it . that 's why i bet .
that 's the bet . that you 're not doing it .
we did n't bet on if you wanted to . we bet on if it would be done .
well of course it could be done . anything could be done . but it only is done if it 's done . show me the levels . the bet is the levels .
that 's the bet . hello ? no oh hi no they just left oh my god hang on a second . maybe i can still catch em . ma . ma . up here . do n't get in the cab . manya died . manya died .
uncle leo .
i do n't know . he said he 'd call back .
what ?
you do n't think what ? the pony remark ?
you do n't think that i killed her ?
it was just an innocent comment . i did n't know she had a pony .
the whole thing was taking out of context . it was a joke . that 's probably uncle leo .
wednesday ? what what wednesday ?
ah
i 've got the softball game on wednesday . it 's the championship .
i did n't even know the woman .
i mean i met her three times . i do n't even know her last name .
i mean who has a funeral on a wednesday ? that 's what i want to know . i mean it 's the championship i 'm hitting everything .
i do n't know what to do .
we do n't understand death . and the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow . and uh i mean hey you know . i think if you ca n't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point i do n't see how bedding accessories really make the difference . i mean they got the guy in a suit with a pillow . now is he going to a meeting or is he catching forty winks ? i mean let 's make up our mind where we think they 're going .
two forty five .
two o clock .
depends on how nice the person was . but you got to figure even oswald took forty five minutes .
you know if the situation were reversed and manya had some mah jongg championship or something i would n't expect her to go to my funeral . i would understand .
i know and then you say to yourself from this moment on i 'm not going to waste any more of it . but then you go how ? what can i do that 's not wasting it ? '
me ? what about you ? you brought up the pony .
bender .
fifty years they were married . now he 's moving to pheonix .
i do n't know . they 've been in there since like world war ii . the rent 's three hundred a month .
well the game 's starting just about now .
i just wanted to say how sorry i was
yeah .
once again i just want to say how sorry i am about the other night .
you know jeffery ?
it 's raining ? it 's raining . the game will be postponed . we 'll play tomorrow .
it 's never happened to me before .
i 'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life .
i thought there were two outs .
oh well of course . nineteen seventy three .
wonder about what ?
you think manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me ?
but i went to the funeral .
do n't you think she woulda heard i was there ?
who figures and immigrant 's going to have a pony ?
what is the pony ? what is the point of the pony ? why do we have these animals these ponies ? what do we do with them ? besides the pony ride . why ponies ? what are we doing with them ? i mean police do n't use them for you know crowd control . hey uh you want to get back behind the barricades . hey . hey little boy . yeah i 'm talking to you . behind the barricades . so somebody i assume genetically engineered these ponies . do you think they could make them any size ? i mean could they make them like the size of a quarter if they wanted ? that would be fun for monopoly though would n't it ? just have a little pony and you put him on the baltic that 's two down go ahead . hold it . right there . baltic . yeah that 's it . fine . right there hold it right there . '
why do n't they open up an entire store for the back ? call it just back . all back no front . you walk in the front you 're immediately in the back . look elaine tie carwash .
her father wrote that .
i guess i 'm coming . i mean
no i 'll go . i 'm going .
i 'm worried i wo n't be able to talk to him . he 's such a great writer . frankly i prefer the company of nitwits .
what is this ?
this is beautiful . these jackets never fit me right .
this may be the most perfect jacket i have ever put on .
how much is it ?
bad ? very bad ?
i have some idea .
i 've got a ballpark .
let me see that . that is high .
what 's with the pink lining and the candy stripes ?
should i get it ? i hate these moments . i 'm hearing the dual voices now you know what about the money ? what 's money ? '
hey .
what do you think ?
is it me ?
really ?
i do n't know . it 's got a pink lining .
what 's the difference ?
i 'd rather not say it out loud . it 's embarrassing .
yes but let 's just stop it right there .
would you ?
i know i know .
i do n't know .
maybe .
do you want it ?
okay take it .
what is that song ?
you know schumann went mad from that .
no you idiot .
you do n't know robert schumann ? the composer ?
he went crazy from one note . he could n't get it out of his head . i think it was an a . he kept repeating it over and over again . he had to be institutionalized .
i know exactly what 's going to happen tonight . i 'm going to try and act like i 'm not impressed he 's going to see right through it .
let me just get my jacket .
wednesday . this jacket has completely changed my life . when i leave the house in this it 's with a whole different confidence . like tonight i might 've been a little nervous . but inside this jacket i am composed grounded secure that i can meet any social challenge .
absolutely .
i know .
well what kind of solid ?
birds ?
so take a cab .
i ca n't . i 'm on my way out . there 's no way i can do it .
two minutes . believe me i know his two minutes . by his conception of time his life will last over two thousand years .
schumann . where are they ?
what you do n't want to do this ?
yeah i think it is . where 's elaine ?
excuse me . mister benes ?
i 'm jerry elaine 's friend and this is george .
sure .
i 'll have a cranberry juice with two limes .
well we thought she was meeting you earlier . she 's usually pretty punctual . do n't you find that george ?
yeah yeah . sometimes she 's on time and sometimes she 's late .
it appears that way .
yup .
i 'm just a regular person .
would you excuse me a minute ? i 'm going to go to the bathroom . i 'll be right back .
that was brutal . i ca n't go back out there .
elaine 'll kill me .
she 's got to be here soon .
the waiter was trembling .
how are we going to get out of it ?
yeah that 's good . he 'd clunk our heads together like moe .
all fathers are intimidating . they 're intimidating because they are fathers . once a man has children for the rest of his life his attitude is to hell with the world i can make my own people . i 'll eat whatever i want i 'll wear whatever i want and i 'll create whoever i want . '
well guatamala
what about elaine ?
she 'll be furious .
that 's her . she 's here .
where have you been ? .
oh you did n't
great .
oh no no .
i ca n't believe it . you know better than to get involved with kramer .
ah the lift . like the lure of the siren 's song . never what it seems to be yet who among us can resist ?
snow . snow that ca n't be good for suede can it ?
what should i do ? uh we 're taking a cab are n't we ?
inside out . great .
oh i turned my jacket inside out .
well it 's a new suede jacket . it might get ruined .
elaine ?
come on up .
hey .
so ?
i ca n't believe i do .
yeah .
i was out in the snow last night .
i have an idea . we can make the nine thirty at cinema three .
is he still in town ?
i do n't know .
really ?
well i ca n't wear it .
yeah go ahead take it .
oh because of all the singing ?
i 'll try and remember that .
yeah too bad .
i had a leather jacket that got ruined . now why does moisture ruin leather ? i do n't get this . are n't cows outside most of the time ? i do n't understand it . when it 's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse let us in we 're all wearing leather . open the door . we 're going to ruin the whole outfit here . is it suede ? i am suede the whole thing is suede i ca n't have this cleaned . it 's all i got .
so you did n't ask ?
counter .
he said wuss ?
so you called .
yeah . like a farm boy .
wow . the enthusiastic hi . that 's beautiful .
all right so you 're chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi go ahead .
and ?
great day in the morning .
sure it 's like robbing a bank . you do n't loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money . you come in you hit and get out .
come on try it . let me hear you try a scottish accent .
irish scottish what 's the difference lassie ?
you 're welcome .
oh that 's okay .
okay but there 's no cake or anything if that 's what you 're looking for .
i think if one 's going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note . it 's common courtesy . i do n't know . that 's just the way i was brought up .
oh so important . so what are you doing uh thursday night ? you want to have dinner ?
tan pants . why do i buy tan pants donna ? i do n't feel comfortable in them .
oh i ca n't begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial .
you like that commercial ?
now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty ?
what could you possibly like about that ?
yeah they 're so funny and so comfortable with each other and i could be comfortable too if i had pants like that . i could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session .
even if the dialogue did ring true . even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that what does that have to do with the pants ? does n't that bother you ?
but they 're talking about nothing .
i know the point .
i mean all those quick shots of the pants . just pants pants pants pants pants pants pants . what is that supposed to be ?
what 's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through . because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future you have to magnify everything about them . you know like the guy 'll be like i do n't think her eyebrows are even . could i look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life ? and of course the woman 's looking at the guy thinking what is he looking at ? do i want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life ? '
i 'm supposed to see her again on thursday but can i go out with someone who actually likes this commercial ?
no kidding . did you tell him that was the reason ?
you 're still thinking about this ?
she thinks you 're a guy that does n't like coffee .
i like to use my own material .
why do we have to leave ?
you 're kicking me out of my house ?
do n't do the apples . it 's enough already with the apples .
i 'm just going to get my jacket i 'll meet you downstairs . what 's the matter did you call ?
what did you say ?
after one date you try and improvise on her machine ?
she 'll call you back . you 're overreacting .
not once .
i have never seen one episode of i love lucy in my life ever .
thank you .
yes i 'm lactose intolerant .
i have no patience for lactose . and i wo n't stand for it . um i 'll be right back .
what ? what did what did you say ?
well so what if i said that ?
no i had to tell my friends my friends did n't have to tell you .
i said i could n't believe you liked that commercial . so what ?
boy i bet you got a regular algonquin round table there .
oh uh kramer this is donna .
donna really you 're making too much of this .
please donna
do n't worry about it it was n't working anyway .
i 'll tell you later .
you said that ?
i ca n't blame you . i ca n't believe she never called you back .
what ?
so she did n't get the messages .
but what about the messages ?
elaine 's thing ? how you going to get in ?
but you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she 's going right for that machine .
there 's nothing to it . you lift the lid it comes right out .
what ?
how you going to get me up there ?
and who makes the switch ?
i do .
i ca n't get involved in this .
what if she sees me ?
a wuss ?
did you call me a wuss ?
i got one problem . you 're keeping her busy in the other room . now what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in ? you have to signal me that she 's coming .
tippy toe ? i do n't think so .
no tippy toe .
what song ?
what is that ?
anything else ?
lemon tree . '
no trini lopez .
standard . micro .
feel good .
not at all .
all the time .
hi .
you know i really need to use the bathroom .
uh you know why do n't you go first you just had a long trip .
um you know it 's the damnedest thing . it went away .
right . i am .
hey you two . i 'm ready to go .
yes .
i love my phone machine . i wish i was a phone machine . i wish if i saw somebody on the street i did n't want to talk to i could go excuse me i 'm not in right now . if you would just leave a message i could walk away . i also have a cordless phone but i do n't like that as much because you ca n't slam down a cordless phone . you get mad at somebody on a real phone you ca n't talk to me like that . bang . you know . you get mad at somebody on a cordless phone you ca n't talk to me like that . '
look at you . why do n't you use a fork ? you 're no good with the sticks .
you stink . you know you stink . what is this ?
oh . your ballet tickets .
no but i 've seen people on tiptoes .
a beard ?
yes .
why are you doing this ?
yeah .
well what about me ?
it sounds like an excellent idea .
you ca n't go wrong with pouty .
hey lou who 's that woman over there ?
yeah i think i will . i like the idea of having the law on my side .
and did they suspect anything ?
and we discover yet another talent . posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals .
you said that already .
yeah .
oh no . do n't tell me . you like him ?
yeah but ?
so ?
not conversion . you 're thinking conversion ?
you think you can get him to just change teams ? he 's not going to suddenly switch sides . forget about it .
because when you join that team it 's not a whim . he likes his team . he 's set with that team .
yeah we do . we do have a good team .
they 're only comfortable with their equipment .
of course you did . everyone gets along great when there 's no possibility of sex .
you realize you 're venturing into uncharted waters .
are you that desperate ?
so are you going to bring your gun ? all right then it 's settled . first date no weapons all right i 'll see you then okay bye .
what are you looking for ?
sorry . i do n't have any tupperware .
what about a plastic bag ?
what is the difference ?
so did you describe yourself to her over the phone ?
what did you say to her ?
i do n't know .
as you see it ?
did you tell her about uh your little hat there ?
you know you 're little hair hat there .
do n't you think she could tell ?
are you kidding ? i could spot that birdo s nest two blocks away .
have you noticed people staring at your head ?
well i think you should either take it off or tell her about it .
oh i 'll split a cab with you .
hi sarge .
what 's that ?
oh . let me ask you when someone is lying is it true that their pants are actually on fire ?
really .
no .
i admit it . i do n't watch it .
the poly ?
yes . melrose place .
well i do .
well maybe i was a little embarrassed .
and billy and jake and allison yes we could have discussed it .
the point is i 'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle 's going to be going wild .
it 's too stupid to confess . look at what i 'm confessing to .
i do n't know . maybe i can beat the machine .
hey you know what ? i have access to one of the most deceitful duplicitous deceptive minds of our time . who better to advise me ?
did you shake it up ?
you got to shake it up .
yeah that 's a real nuisance . this is killing me .
so tonight are you going to make the move ?
hey there he is . so what happened ? could she detect it ?
how so ?
she 's bald ?
women go bald ?
hey .
good to have you back .

so george how do i beat this lie detector ?
come on you 've got the gift . you 're the only one that can help me .
all right well i 've got to go take this test . i ca n't believe i 'm doing this .
what ?

elaine do you know what you 've done ? you 've give hope to every woman who 's ever said too bad he 's gay .
jerry seinfeld .
NUM west NUMst street .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
i do n't know .
yes . that stupid idiot . he left her for kimberly he slept with her sister . he tricked her into giving him half her business and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again . i mean she 's crazy . how could she do something like that ? oh that jane she makes me so mad .
he went back ? what do you mean he went back ?
i do n't understand it . you were having such a great time the sex the shopping .
you ca n't . that 's why they lose very few players .
well there 's always a place for you on our team .
yeah . it 's coming on in a few minutes .
hey . do n't worry it has n't started .
all right shut up shut up melrose place is coming on .
oh that michael i hate him he 's just so smug .
i would think .
you do n't flamenco on the first date .
yeah ? would you do it ?
well i knew you 'd have an affinity for it because it 's the dance of a very proud people .
hello . oh hi nana . what ? oh . oh alright okay . do n't worry about it . okay i 'll see you later . alright bye .
i have to go over to my grandmother 's .
i have to open a bottle of ketchup for her .
no we have time .
ah she 's starting to slip a little . sometimes she has difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present .
like toothpaste ?
there 's a squeeze ketchup .
well if they make squeeze mustard does n't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup ?
i really do n't see the difference .
it 's subtle .
yeah there she is . uh oh .
ah she 's with her friend wendy .
yeah . i 'm on a kiss hello program with her .
yeah . every time i see her i got to kiss her hello . i just did it once on her birthday somehow it mushroomed . now i dread seeing her because of it .
ah that 's fortunate . i really admire that .
no i told you i admire your hearing .
no do n't slough that off you have great hearing .
bye .
well i 'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello . i am getting off the kiss program with her .
well you know frankly outside of a sexual relationship i do n't see the point to it . i 'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either but one step at a time .
and what 's with that hairdo by the way ?
she looks like something out of an old high school yearbook . you should say something to her .
yeah . kramer 's the only person who could say something like that .
what you have to do is introduce him and then he 'll just come out with it .
speak of the devil .
what for ?
why ?
i i do n't want my picture plastered up in the lobby .
kramer i do n't want to stop and talk with everyone every time i go in the building . i just want to nod and be on my way .
hello uncle leo .
nana called me to open the ketchup bottle .
hi nana .
yes . yes of course .
what 're you doing i got it .
will you stop it .
uncle leo . alright . take it .
i 'm just not getting any hot water .
thanks julio .
huh ?
what 's going on here ?
well then what 're you doing ?
what for ?
you 're looking for a picture of me are n't you ?
i told you forget it .
you 're robbing me .
so ? are you sure wendy 's coming ?
well this 'll be a very interesting experiment to see if kramer says something . you sure you want to go through with this ?
hello . oh hi mom . yeah i was at nana 's yesterday . i had to help her open a ketchup bottle . hey mom let me ask you a question . do you remember when you were a kid your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track ? really ? did you know he gave uncle leo a hundred dollars and he was supposed to give you fifty ? how do i know ? because nana does n't know what year it is and she thinks this just happened . well i think you should . okay bye .
yeah ?
come on up .
no no he 'll come in . well this is going to be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello .
it 's the obligation you know ? as soon as this person comes in you know you have to do this . i mean if you could say touch a breast as part of the kiss hello then i think i could see the value in it a little better .
elaine now you 're being ridiculous .
hi wendy .
would you like something to drink ?
there you go .
oh look at that . i 'm almost outta klondike bars .
so how 's everything going ?
oh yeah he had to take his mother to the chiropodist .
c 'mon that 's not fair .
no c 'mon kramer . gimme that picture .
alright fine . put my picture up . what do i care ?
oh my god . look at that picture it 's terrible
you ca n't put that picture up .
oh . hello uh mary .
yeah .
oh sure yeah .
oh no .
you see ? that 's just what i need . more kissing .
what is so funny ?
hello . oh hi mom . what ? oh my he did n't ? . he could n't . alright i will . okay bye .
uncle leo put nana in a home .
i do n't know . maybe to keep her quiet .
hi joan .
pretty good .
okay great .
oh i 'm delighted .
you too .
hi louise .
ah well . thank you very much .
for putting my picture up on that wall . i 'm like richard dawson down there now . and every person i see engages me in this long boring tedious conversation . i ca n't even get out of the building .
family ?
you think i want another family ? my father 's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen forty one and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up . and i tell you another thing cosmo kramer whatever you want to be called . the kissing thing is over . there 's no more kissing and i do n't care what the consequences are .
yes it 's very strange . very strange .
i tell you . if you were hitch hiking you 'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that .
you should have her work on it for you .
hi mary .
uh listen . i decided i ca n't kiss hello anymore . i 'm sorry . it 's nothing personal
it just makes me a little uncomfortable and i ca n't do it . i 'm sorry .
hi louise
i was just telling mary how i 'm not going to be doing the kiss hello thing anymore . i 'm sorry . i just ca n't do it . it 's nothing personal it 's just i 'm not really able to do it and uh i 'm sorry .
thank you for your cooperation .
hello .
hi mom . so what 's happening with uncle leo ? is he paying you ?
okay i will .
oh i got to go visit my nana in the nursing home .
hey kramer look at this .
look at my picture .
i 've been defaced .
hi jack .
hey julio . i was wondering could you get to that shower today you think ?
no no that 's not true .
you know she really does n't belong here . my uncle put her here because he 's trying to prove he does n't owe my mother fifty dollars .
buddy ?
so you were with him that day at the track ?
leo ?
is that so ?
well that 's very interesting .
uncle leo . i just met an old acquaintance of yours . you remember buddy . he just told me quite a story about you and grandpa at the track .
you 're busted .
hey steve . how you doing ?
hey jeff . what 's happening ?
mary . oh mary . give us a kiss .
do n't be like that mary . c 'mon i made a mistake .
oh paul could you hold that door
hey . could i use your shower ?
i got a date . c 'mon please .

the doorman . i do n't want to play anymore of his mindgames . what time does he get off ?
well it 's almost six now . ca n't we just wait til he goes home ?
we 'll still make the movie .
uh that doorman 's still milling around outside . he 's very peculiar .
hello ? oh hi mr . pitt .
alright he just left . we can go .
you ? wh what 're you doing here ? you work at this building too ?
so you work all day as a doorman at one building . then you come home and stand outside your own building ?
look i 'm not going in your building . i really do n't have to talk to you . goodbye .
yeah and ?
what do you mean breasts ?
so what ? a lot of older men have that .
but your father 's not bald .
then i suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother .
boy that brain never stops working does it ?
what ? nothing .
what has this guy got a personal vendetta with me ? . what 'd i do to him ? cos i asked him about the knicks ?
no .
alright . can we go to a later show so he 's off his shift when i come by ?
yes we do .
he 's trying to get something off his chest .
hoh . what 're you doing here ? you 're supposed to be gone .
look i do n't want any trouble . i do n't have a doorman in my building . i guess i 'm just not used to talking to them . i 'd really just like to be friends .
i 'd like to be .
what ?
wha ? wai wait a second . what do i do ?
oh .
hey hey . wait a second . hey . hello .
hey hey wait a second . you live here ?
you think you 're better than me ?
oh right .
yeah yeah yeah .
he left me there . you see the mind games ?
yeah .
he asked me to . we were getting along .
do n't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves the couch gets stolen ? maybe he 's setting me up .
alright well what if we say
i came to pick you up .
i know . i was just
alright well . just start again then .
right .
what ? i said right .
but the doorman 's going to say that i was there .
but i do n't know if this is going to work .
okay .
you 're saying i 'm responsible for the couch ?
diabolical . he thought of everything . he was setting me up from day one .
i 'm sure he 's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies .
now we have to buy a new couch ? .
the one with the poppie stain ? .
it 's hardly been used .
poppie .
what 're you doing here ?
ohh . hey how you feeling ?
hmm .

i do n't think so . '
elaine i really do n't pay much attention to men`s faces . '
no i find them repugnant and unappealing . '
to wit'
no elaine and i we 're just discussing whether i could admit a man is attractive . '
really . '
just one got to go back oh but get this . elaine you will appreciate this . i 'm sitting in tim whatley 's waiting room he 's got a penthouse right out on the table . '
yeah . what is that ? i mean is n't that sick . i mean i 'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment . '
he 's a doctor . . i mean it 's supposed to be like a sterile environment . '
of course but that 's got nothing to do with it . '
what are you doing that for you got a job'
yeah . what 's that . '
jimmy 's got a record . jimmy 's jumping for dollars . jimmt and george are going to get rich . '
kom pau(sp ? '

so what did tim say ? '
looks like he gave you some novocaine'
so what about the penthouse . did you ask him ? '
adults only ? '

you find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist .
hey . hey . watch it . . you 're drooling all over the floor . how much novocaine did that guy give you . '
why are you taking this so personally ? '
what about the velvet fog ? '

yeah .
what ?
oooh . you . you ate these ? you sucked on these and put them on the plate ?
soo
no no i do n't i mean do n't be silly
it 's just
oh . man did you see that . i ate discarded food .
yeah but with you it 's intentional .
yeah but this is different this is like you know semi digested food stuff . you know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there .
ah . yes that 's going to make a big difference .
hey you think that shelly 's upset that i made such a big deal about the pecan .
thanks .
ah . boy .
yeah . so
yeah . it 's a doodle .
oh . . it 's an affectionate caricature .
it 's just a drawing .
the usual
good for you
oh . come on you told them you 're from out of town just so you could stay in a hotel room .
well be sure to catch a broadway show while you 're in town .
oh . there coming to town tomorrow by the way .
do n't ask .
no it 's george
you know my parents are coming in and i got some clean up to do so if you and potsie are done scheming
what 's in ?
aah . right . the ones from oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year
nah i do n't want to
i do n't want it
i do n't want it
i am not going to taste your peach . i ate some one 's pecan last night i 'm not going to eat your peach .
what is this ?
yeah . i think i got flea bites .
look at this my ankle 's all bitten up .
no .
how could i have fleas ?
what did you do about them ?
nothing
mom dad i have fleas
i do n't get this . how did this happen . i do n't have a dog .
i do n't understand this
nobody can be in here for NUM hours i got my parents in town .
okay
i have fleas .
i do n't know but every one 's got to clear out of the apartment for two days . i do n't know what i 'm going to do with my parents . they 'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own i 'm sure it 's going to be some awful dump . wait a second have you checked in the plaza yet ?
come on c 'mon
c 'mon c 'mon
c 'mon c 'mon
yes .
yes .
i dunno i 'm going to ask shelley but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident .
yeah when he 's dead he 'll be relieved oh by the way viking press sent a fedex for you to my parents . they brought it with em .
you see the thing of it is there 's a lot of ugly people out there walking around but they do n't know they 're ugly because nobody actually tells them .
i dunno
that 'd be the fleas .
hey .
yeah . it 's all taken care of .
oh . hey .
yeah . i got it . it 's in the apartment but we ca n't go in there it 's being fumigated .
you see ?
i told you to take it .
well you ca n't go in there it 's like a gas chamber in there .
kramer they 're fumigating . there 's toxic gas in there .
aw . you 'll be fine you were in there for what a couple of minutes .
how do you feel ?
well wh wh . what are you doing ?
did n't you see the sign on the door ?
can you get me a soda ?
i do n't know . who couldo ve been in my apartment .
wait a minute . did you say chunky wrappers ?
let me see those . oh . i know the chunky that left these chunkies newman . i 've got him .
newman . open the door newman i know you 're in there .
there 's nothing pleasant about it so lets just cut the crap you gave me fleas . i know it and you know it
oh . but i do . there 's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar .
you know newman the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to itch . oh . maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while no matter how much will power a person may have . it wo n't matter because they 're crawling crawling on your skin . up your legs up your spine up your back
hey thanks a lot for letting me stay here .
oh . damn
i forgot my toothbrush .
yours ? you know what i 'll think i 'll brush later .
sure .
oh . my god . what the hell is this ? do n't tell me velvet .
she 's seen you in this thing .
and now the search for the right psychiatrist begins .
ahh . she threw me out .
i would n't use her toothbrush .
well i guess i 'm stuck with the velvet fog .
i hear you 're going out with david putty .
well i think he couldo ve asked me . supposed to be a friend of mine .
elaine you always care who an ex girlfriend dates . you do n't want it to be someone you know and you do n't want it to be someone better than you . now even though the latter is obviously impossible .
the former still applies . i do n't know what it is but i just ca n't see you with a mechanic .
all right .
hi .
yeah so .
what move ?
wait a second . my move ?
david putty used my move ?
are you sure ?
i ca n't believe it . he stole my move .
oh it was n't like that . i did n't even mention you . you know we were in the garage . you know how garages are . they 're conducive to sex talk . it 's a high testosterone area .
well i 'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it .
what ?
no . he stole my move .
yeah but it 's like another comedian stealing my material .
oh yeah . the pinch . i 've done the pinch . that 's not new . besides which i do n't know how you could trust any of his moves now . his whole repertoire could be lifted .
i know he 's probably the only honest mechanic in new york .
so he stole my move and he 's using it on elaine .
can i just get it opened first ?
all right all right . here . .
you feel better ?
nancy klopper ?
all right george . i 'm going to tell you . but i just want to make sure before
it 's not even a question of that . the point is when something like this is passed along one must be certain that it 's going to be used in a conscientious way . this is not some parlor trick to be used
all right . on your bed . you got a headboard ? you 'll need a headboard .
is it padded ?
good . how tall is she ?
you ca n't have more than a one foot differential in your heights . otherwise you could really hurt your neck .
george if you could master this you 'll never be alone again .
now the ending is kind of an option . i use the swirl . i like the swirl . i 'm comfortable with the swirl . i feel the swirl is a great capper . he uses the pinch which i find a little presumptuous .
i prefer clockwise but it 's not written in stone .
what is it ?
when did you do this ?
oh why fusilli ?
well thank you very much .
assman ?
who would order a license plate that says assman ?
it does n't have to be someone who gets a lot of women . it could be just some guy with a big ass .
yeah . proctologist .
i 'll tell you where i 'd like to stick it .
hey david .
hey what 's the story ? i hear you 're doing my move .
what move ? my move . the one i told you about . you used it on elaine .
the ending is the whole thing . without the ending it 's nothing . you had nothing .
swirl .
oh yeah i know . you do the pinch .
you ca n't come up with your own stuff so you steal other peoples ? you 're nothing but a hack .
well i 'll tell you what i 'll do you know . if you want to do it out of town okay . but not in the city .
fine .
you must have done something wrong . you probably screwed up the order . did you close with the swirl ?
oh my god . yes you close with the swirl . there 's a progression there . i told you to write it down .
yeah ?
c 'mon up . you know what ? do me a favor . do n't even do the move anymore . you 're going to give it a bad name .
hello ? yeah this is jerry seinfeld . what ? twenty eight hundred dollars ? . that 's the estimate on my car ? . no do n't even do anything . i 'm going to think about it . okay bye .
except that it 's not putty .
eh we had a little fight about the move . i took her to this other place . i think they might be trying to screw me .
hey elaine .
is it something i said ?
really ?
what is it ?
huh .
listen . i need you to do me a favor . when 's the next time you 're going to see him ?
you got to get an estimate on my car from him . i think this garage is trying to screw me .
well look . here 's the work order with everything that broke . just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out .
that 's uh fusilli jerry .
yeah . kramer made it .
hey assman .
hi .
sixteen hundred dollars ? that 's all ? ooh they are ripping me off .
well that 's it . i 'm going back to putty . no move is worth this .
are you kidding ? he can do every move i 've ever done . do you know what a good mechanic is worth ? you ca n't compare that to sex .
hi mr . constanza . what 's uh ?
i do n't know . why ?
what do you mean ?
really stopping short . that 's a good move .
hey .
oh my god .
if i was n't there i would n't have believed it .
he had to use cork screw pasta .
assman .
what time does your flight get in ? six ? all right that gives us six hours . then i 'll meet you at the diplomat 's club . i 'll be the one without the big red sash . okay see you tonight .

well i did n't really get a good hello' but see i was at a funeral .
see so i do n't know if i got a funeral hello or he was mad because he did n't get his day after thank you .
look what do you want me to do ?
no . no i ca n't .
look we got five hours before the game . i am betting it was a funeral hello . he knows we 're here he knows the number he knows we want to go . there 's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets .
hello ? oh hi mom . no listen i was expecting somebody else . i 'm sorry i ca n't talk now i got to keep the line clear i 'll call you later . yes i know i have call waiting but i do n't trust it in an emergency . good bye .
no .
alright . hello alec ? hi it 's jerry seinfeld . you know you got a great john housemang name . alec berg . did you hand in your assignment mr . berg ?
well alec the reason i called is i just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night .
oh you already gave them away ?
no we do n't care we just want to go .
what did you do ?
well looks are so subjective .
maybe .
harold and manny .
boys boys .
i slid the rent under your door harold . did you get it ?
she died ? mrs . hudwalker died ?
are you kidding ? you know my friend elaine ?
it 's not promised to anybody ? cause she 'd take it in a second .
so it 's okay ? i could just tell her she can have it ?
oh nothing important .
what look ? nothing .
i do n't know if you should sit for this or not . sitting is good if you faint but standing is good for jumping up and down . i ca n't decide .
oh elaine . you know the way i am rarely ever thinking of myself . my only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me . sure it hurts sometimes to give and give and give
what would you say if i told you that
i got you an apartment in this building .
yes .
yes .
i did .
i got you an apartment in the building .
remember mrs . hudwalker ? the ninety four year old woman who lived above me ?
she died .
she died .
and the rent is only four hundred dollars a month .
four hundred a month .
right upstairs .
right above me .
all the time .
all the time .
the problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing . i think life would be a lot better if it was like you 're always making a movie . you mess up somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot . you know what i mean ? think of the things you wish you could take back . you 're out somewhere with people gee you look pregnant are you ? cut cut cut cut cut that 's not going to work at all . walk out the door and come back in . let 's take this whole scene again . people think about what you 're saying . '
you ca n't believe what i just did .
i could tell you what i did but you would n't believe it . it 's not believable .
how could i have done that ?
i told elaine about an apartment opening up in my building . she 's going to move in .
yes . right above me .
yeah .
i know . neighbors .
right above me .
cause i 'm an idiot . you may think you 're an idiot but with all due respect i 'm a much bigger idiot than you are .
did you ever ask an ex girlfriend to move into your building ?
she 's right in my building . right above me . every time i come in the building i 'm going to have to sneak around like a cat burglar .
but i need the home bed advantage .
come in for two minutes and sit with me .
oh who 's going to know ?
two minutes .
my censoring system broke down . you know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say ? makes sure you do n't make a mistake ? he went for a cup of coffee . and in that second ruined my life .
so is there any way out of this elaine thing ?
you know the water pressure 's terrible in my building . and she loves a good shower .
if they were fanatic about showers they might .
look at that woman feeding her baby greasy disgusting coffee shop corned beef hash . is n't that child abuse ?
yeah the guy with the flat head .
yeah i 've heard that about wedding bands .
that would be an interesting sociological experiment . you know kramer has his father 's band . he 'd loan it to you .
boys boys .
what ?
hey hey . i understand . you 're businessmen .
well that 's a lot of money . but if that 's the way it 's got to be that 's the way it 's got to be .
you know i used to think that the universe is a random chaotic sequence of meaningless events but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things .
religion my friend that 's what happened to me . because i have just been informed that it 's going to cost elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs .
of course she does n't have five thousand dollars .
ca n't get it .
no move . so you see it 's all part of a divine plan .
elaine ?
all right this is going to require some great acting now . i have to pretend i 'm disappointed . you 're going to really see me being a phony now . i hope you can take this . maybe you should go in the other room .
cause you know i love elaine .
but you know not in the building . really i feel terrible about this . my intentions were good . what can i do ? tell me .
well there 's a little bit of a problem .
uh no uh someone offered harold and manny five thousand for the apartment . i 'm sure they 'd just as soon give it to you but you 'd have to come up with that money .
i know .
i have no idea .
yeah well i did n't is that something you want to borrow ?
she does n't want to borrow the money .
who said there 's a problem ?
it was all over . taken care of . done . finished . five thousand . where 's she going to get five thousand ? she does n't have five thousand . clean . good bye . she 's gone . then you come in why do n't you loan her five thousand ? what do you care ? you 've got five thousand . give her five thousand . '
no i did n't .
people do n't turn down money . it 's what separates us from the animals .
let me explain something to you . you see you 're not normal . you 're a great guy i love you but you 're a pod . i on the other hand am a human being . i sometimes feel awkward uncomfortable even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings . you would n't understand .
hi
yes it 's my life 's work .
well better load up on some carbos before the race .
oh yes . particularly if you 're not in it .
what 's to see ? a woman from norway a guy from kenya and twenty thousand losers .
hi how are ya ?
fantastic .
i know .
it 's tremendous .
i 'm in heaven .
oh i would n't quite say that .
i 'm a guy it always looks like that .
nah
you have no idea what an idiot is . elaine just gave me a chance to get out and i did n't take it . this is an idiot .
george i did n't sleep at all last night . i decided i have to tell her . i 'm just going to be honest . that 's all yes i 'm nervous are you listening to me ? just put some soap on your finger . it 'll slide right off then try axle grease i 'll call you back after i talk to her bye .
what ? what 's cool ?
what are you talking about ?
you what ? . get out . ten thousand ?
who would pay that much ?
elaine would never borrow that much money . kramer my god man . this is beautiful . i think i 'm in the clear here . elaine 's not moving in . i do n't have to confront her . she has no idea i never wanted her to move in . i 'm golden .
it 's just unbelievable .
all the time . i 've been up there six times . they refuse to stop . i ca n't live like this . i do n't know what i 'm going to do . i 'm heading for breakdown . ca n't you do something ?
manny
i do n't know . what do you do when a neighbor is making like a lot of noise at three o'clock in the morning ? i mean can you knock on someone 's door and tell them to keep it down ? you 're really altering your whole self image . i mean what am i fred mertz now ? what 's happening to me ? can i do this ? am i a shusher ? i used to be a shushee . there 's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters . people are always shushing . shh shh shhh shhh does n't work cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from . they just hear a shh . was that a shush ? i think somebody just shushed me . some people you ca n't shush in a movie theater . there 's always that certain group of people is n't it ? they 're talking and talking and everyone around them is shushing them and shushing them . they wo n't shush . they 're the unshushables .
now what am i supposed to do here ? shall i go over there ? it 's not like somebody died . it 's beaches for godo s sake . if she was sitting next to me i 'd put my arm around her . i ca n't be making a big move like going all the way over there . i ca n't . i wo n't .
she calls me this morning and tells me she 's upset i did n't console her . i mean it was beaches for godo s sake . what what do you do in a situation like that ?
i was sitting on the chair . she was over here on the couch .
of course .

that 's great .
that looks pretty good .
hey say you know we have n't even discussed george 's engagement yet .
come on . george is getting married .
yeah he seems pretty happy .
what 's the matter ?
well you do n't seem too enthused about the whole thing .
well at least have some reaction to it .
maybe you 're a little jealous .
no . but maybe you wish it was you who was getting married not him .
oh yeah . right .
lainy .
you do n't want to get married ?
oh come on .
you 're such
hey .
we 're going to change the system .

extend the doors on the toilet stalls at yankee stadium to the floor door comes down . hides your feet . yes . i like it . i like it a lot .
i think it 's fantastic . i think it 's a fantastic idea .
yes i do .
hmm .
see now that i do n't care for .
it should resolve of its own volition .
momentum same thing .
yeah i know .
you 're turning .
if you need more time you should have more time .
sure you can . why not ?
i do n't see why not .
sure go ahead .
spring . of course .
beautiful .
no she 's not .
well she 's a woman . they do n't like to be disappointed .
yeah you 'd better shoot for march .
oh all the way .
is that so ?
hey kramer if i killed somebody would you turn me in ?
you 're kidding ?
you would turn me in ?
i ca n't believe your a friend of mine .
well i am sure i had a good reason .
but you know me .
so you 're nothing but a stoolie . admit it .
another caf&eacute latte ?
hey baby . i set the trends . who do you think started this whole caf&eacute latte ?
i do n't recall you drinking caf&eacute latte .
hey planet NUM from outer space is playing tomorrow night . one show only .
you know i was supposed to see this five years ago . i was in a chinese restaurant with george and elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and i missed it .
look at this jerry dropping paper on the ground . that 's littering .
maybe you better call the cops and turn me in .
let me take a guess . she cried and you caved .
i live and breath my friend . . . . i live and breath .
tes it 's very difficult . few men have the constitution for it . that 's why breakups take two or three tries . you got to build up your immunity .
well at least you probably had some uh pretty good make up sex after .
you did n't have make up sex ? how could you not have make up sex ? i mean that 's the best feature of the heavy relationship .
in your situation the only sex you 're going to have better than make up sex is if you 're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit .
. . . poor bastard .
good evening rabbi .
well rabbi well .
yeah that 's right .
what do you mean ?
no .
is that so ?
really ?
i did n't know any of this .
hum well it all comes as news to me .
you iknow i talked to the rabbi outside .
understand you had a little talk with him too .
yes i know i know .
nothing nothing .
yes he did .
we had quite a little chat .
yes about how you 're very jealous of george . how you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him .
it did n't take much prodding either i must say .
he did it .
that 's what 's so fascinating .
you better finish your little caf&eacute latte there . they wo n't let you in with it .
because they do n't allow outside drinks into the movie .
that 's the rule .
excuse me pardon me excuse me
elaine if i could say a word here about jewish people . that man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves .
no . . . about how you wish it was you who was getting married instead of him ? feelings of resentment hostility ?
yeah she 's something else . hey so what happened ? did you hold your ground or uh
what ?
you cried ?
sorry about that movie thing . i was joking around .
suing ? what for ?
it 's supposed to be hot .
why would anyone eat canned fruit ? i mean can anybody answer that ?
i can see the can if you 're in the army but fresh fruit it 's available it 's there it 's NUM aisles over .
where you going ?
discount ?
so ah what did you do last night ?
i know nothing but what did you actually do ?
wow . that really is nothing .
hey .
what are you all dressed up for ?
oh yeah how 's that looking ?
frankly i 'm surprised you 're so litigious .
hi bob .
oh i 'm sorry . maestro .
i hear it 's ah beautiful there .
huh ?
this is a bob cobb .
oh what because i did n't call him maestro ?
ya know i feel a little funny calling somebody maestro .
because it 's a stupid thing to be called .
oh conductor . he conducts the policeman 's benevolent association orchestra .
well he sure worked pretty fast with elaine .
new shirt ?
no not particularly .
yeah .
yeah it 's burning my retina . susan picked that out for you right ?
all right what 's it going to be here .
no .
are you sensing anything right now ?
well what about criminal activity ? he 's got to be alert .
maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down .
i know you will .
his lawyer .
what ?
why are they settling ?
all this because you spilled coffee on yourself ?
what do you mean ?
so ?
i thought they wanted to settle .
then you 're in a lot of trouble .
did you have a good time ?
yeah everyone knows that it was in amadeus .
so what about the maestro stuff . did he make you call him maestro .
you did n't mind ?
ok from now on i want you to call me jerry the great .
why not you call him maestro .
well i 'm great .
what about his house in tuscany he mention that ?
you know when i told him it was beautiful there out of the clear blue sky he says there 's nothing to rent . as if he does n't want anyone else there .
i do n't know . maybe he 's embarrassed by americans .
in all of tuscany ? i wonder .
hey you know we were just talking about you .
yeah ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in tuscany ?
no . i 'm not really looking .
so are you telling me there 's not one house to rent in all of tuscany ?
i ca n't get a sublet a guest room a cot nothing ?
how 'd you get yours ?
maybe i 'll check out france .
hey george do you believe this guy ?
bob cobb .
you know the maestro .
yeah get this he tells me there are no houses any where in tuscany to rent .
no .
i just wish i could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of tuscany .
i have no idea .
oh no way it 's that big .
do you know how big north dakota is stupid ?
hey no one 's got a gun to your head .
yeah and ?
so are you going to get him a chair ?
yeah that would give him some height be able to check things out . with a back or without .
swivel ?
i thinks it 's kind of a pompous look . you know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect .
yes .
how can i figure out if there 's any places to rent in tuscany ? wait a minute . poppy 's from tuscany . i 'm going to go call him .
poppy told me to talk to his cousin he lives down in little italy .
hey hey hey slow down eddie . what what 's the matter ?
that 's it ?
you 've got to stop it . your your all hopped up on the caffein .
you 're racing .
ah excuse me i 'm looking for a mr . giggio .
poppy sent me to see you mr . giggio .
um did he did he mention to you why i called ?
yeah right right . so is there anything there to rent ?
i did n't actually want to rent it .
so see um i did n't say that i wanted to rent it i was just wondering if there were houses there to rent .
you did n't have to push me .
NUM NUM lira .
kramer you do n't under the conversion rate .
you know i do n't even know why i brought you .
not bad .
i do n't know . blind date ?
yeah but i 've seen pictures of her .
i think i 'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date . the question is whether you 'd rather date the blind or the deaf .
you know i think i would rather date the deaf .
because i think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house . and lets face it they 're not going to get all the crumbs . i 'd possibly be walking around with a sponge .
veggie sandwich and a grapefruit .
a healthy person .
oh sorry
i still ca n't believe you 're going out on a blind date .
you 're going by sound ? what are we ? whales ?
elaine what percentage of people would you say are good looking ?
twenty five percent you say ? no way . it 's like NUM to NUM percent . it 's a twenty to one shot .
way off ? have you been to the motor vehicle bureau ? it 's like a leper colony down there .
undateable .
alcohol .
pulp could n't make it across the table .
hey i eat healthy . if i have to take out an eye that 's the breaks .
hi
well i 'm not really that much of a meat eater .
well no i 'm not one of those .
grandma memma ?
no i think i would have remembered memma .
what do you recommend besides the steak ?
anything lighter ? how do you prepare the chicken ?
you know what ? i think i 'll just have the salad .
just a salad ? just a salad ? just a salad ?
maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog . these muts like to gossip . so have you talked too holly ?
did she mention anything about our lunch ?
what do you mean kind of . ?
what are you saying ? . . . salad . what was i thinking ? women do n't respect salad eaters .
but you 're going over there for dinner tonight right ?
what is she making ?
oh do n't worry . i 'll be there and i 'll be packing an artery .
um mutton . hope you did n't cut the fat off .
hey salado s got nothing on this mutton .
i wish i could take credit for it . it 's actually the line my butcher uses when we 're chewing the fat . how about that beautiful desk over there ?
this is some fine mutton .
uh well uh the thing is that . . .
what ?
i do n't know about that . have you got any floss ?
elaine what are you doing in this neighborhood ?
yeah they 're in the kitchen . . . . okay quite . what 's going on ?
why were dogs chasing you ?
i would askk you to stay tonight but i only have the sofa bed and it 's where i sleep .
head to toe ?
i 'm sorry i did n't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face .
i 'll make them later . uh .
it sounds like all the winking got you a promotion .
because they were in the pockets of my jacket .
yes . i was using them to spit out the mutton .
i do n't know and i did n't want to find out . so where is my jacket ?
you spent the night at james 's ? did we ?
reversed positions ?
so what your genitals are still lined up .
yeah . come on up .
hey . what 's all this ?
i thought we were going out .
franco ?
i bet he acted aloof like he did n't know me .
that is so franco .
i usually like mine with an angioplasty .
what everyone does here . cooking pork chops .
we could argue all night over who took the napkins . the point is in today 's modern world it just does n't seem relevant .
hey what happened to my jacket ?
uh sometimes i use the sofa .
i ca n't believe you write for this j . peterman catalog . get this one i packed my rod and reel . NUM hours later lost in the fiord a welcoming smile . thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my norwegian ice fishing vest .
i thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work .
how do you pull that off ?
yeah he looks busy . yeah .
so did you come up with a little stupid story for the himalayan walking shoe yet ?
what marathon runner ?
oh wait . jean paul jean paul . is n't he the guy who overslept at the olympics NUM years ago and missed the marathon ? .
he 's from uh trinidad and tobago right ?
how do you oversleep at the olympics ?
i mean it 's like the biggest event of your life . you 'd think you 'd have like NUM alarm clocks payin' off little kids in the village to come banging on your door
ah that 's a big responsability on your hands .
you got to wake him up .
i 've seen her in your building .
i did n't know she was married .
whom i going to tell ?
he overslept and missed the whole race . is n't that amazing ?
my money 's on the snooze . i bet he hit the snooze for an extra NUM and it never came back on . imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock .
what do you do ?
always works ?
hot tub ?
is n't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you ?
i do n't ask those kind of questions anymore .
ah hi jean paul . nice to meet you .
sorry about the olympics .
ah catalog writer 's block ?
so what happened ? the snooze alarm was n't it ?
ampm .
ah the volume .
ah separate knob .
some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio .
do n't worry it 's not going to happen again . not if i have anything to say about it .
elaine what 's the alarm clock situation in your house ?
it 's a simple question
that old one ? did n't i once miss a flight to cleveland because of that alarm clock ?
elaine
you 're NUM minutes late . what happened ?
no .
well you said you were going to be here at a certain time and you were n't .
well means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race he 's put his faith in you and frankly i 'm a little concerned .
yes i am .
yeah i know that .
i 'm not talking about upside down . i 'm talking about waking him up .
hey jean paul . how was your soak ? was a good soak ?
what happened ?
yeah . i hope so ? .
kramer i 'm telling you elaine does n't know whatta hell she 's doin' . i got to take over this whole operation .
i 'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got going there .
jean paul i asked you down here this morning because i 'm concerned . concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career . and the person with whom you have chosen to stay is uh

maybe you should check with the rabbi .
come on let 's go jean paul .
which one you want to go to shmoopy ?
you 're a shmoopy .
you 're a shmoopy .
uh we 'll go to NUMrd avenue . so can you come with us for lunch to the soup place ?
all right then . i 'll see you later .
bye shmoopy .
no . we got to go to the soup place .
he 's always raving . i finally got a chance to go there the other day and i tell you this you will be stunned .
you ca n't eat this soup standing up your knees buckle .
there 's only one caveat the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental especially about the ordering procedure . he 's secretly referred to as the soup nazi .
he yells and you do n't get your soup .
just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine .
all right . as you walk in the place move immediately to your right .
the main thing is to keep the line moving .
right . it 's very important not to embellish on your order . no extraneous comments . no questions . no compliments .
elaine .
ar moire .
he gave you the nice face discount .
what about the soup ?
pardon .
it 's like this all the time .
oh no . it is . just be still .
hard to believe .
shhhhh . all right bania i i 'm not letting you cut in line .
because if he catches us we 'll never be able to get soup again .
medium crab bisque .
just forget it . let it go .
oh man . ohh . this is fantastic . how does he do it ?
i gave you a taste . what do you want ?
i told you not to say anything . you ca n't go in there brazenly flaunt the rules and then think i 'm going to share with you .
i 'm sorry . this is what comes from living under a nazi regime .
hi shmoopy .
you 're a shmoopy .
hey listen so we 'll meet you and susan at the movie tonight ?
why ?
just like that ?
hey .
hey . hey . hey . hey . hey . hey . hey . wha what are you doing ?
well sit on one of your couch cushions .
what are you going to get ?
you better decide sister . you 're on deck . sheila .
uh oh .
do i know you ?
it was a bisque .
really ?
have you tastes the soup ?
see the way i figure it it 's much easier to patch things up with sheila than with the soup nazi .
hey .
oh thanks .
so did these thieves want any money ?
they just wanted the armoire ?
yeah ?
hey have you noticed george is acting a little strange lately ?
i do n't know . a lot of attitude like he 's better than me or something .
hello .
absolutely not .
aw we did n't go . sheila and i are kind of on the outs .
yeah . wha wha what are you happy ?
i do n't know but you look like you 're happy .
you ca n't fool me . do n't insult me george because i know when you 're happy .
is that so ?
disgusting ?
well i guess i have all the more reason to get back with her .
what ?
you 're still with the pact ?
all i did was shake your hand .
it was stupid of me .
no . i know . i i was really sort of half kidding .
what about that bavarian cream pie joke i told you ? there 's no truth to that . nobody with a terminal illness goes from the united states to europe for a piece of bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they do n't have it he says aw i 'll just have some coffee . there 's no truth to that .
so am i forgiven shmoopy ?
aw .
oh hi susan george . you remember sheila .
yeah . that 's right . you got a problem ?
well we 're changing the rules .
what about you shmoopy ? how bout a little tuna ? you want a little tuna fishy ?

wait a second elaine . where do you think you 're going ?
elaine i do n't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand . i happen to love that soup .
elaine let the man make his soup .
well . well .
hey susan george .
oh really ?
because we 're kind of not seeing each other anymore .
yeah . well she was very affectionate which i love . you know i love that but mentally we could n't quite make the connection .
yeah . too bad cause you got to have the affection which you obviously have . i think it 's great that you 're so open with your affections in public . see we had that .
oh yeah . but the mental thing . but anyway . i 'll see ya .
what is it ?
wha wha what 's the matter ?
well where are you going ?
so why did n't you tell her the code ?
george you 're going to marry this woman . most likely .
so you 're taking relationship advice from chemical bank now ?
actually that 's the definition of selfish .
no one 's ever asked . you want it ? it 's jor el . '
of course . c 'mon georgie you want to tell me . it 's eating you up inside . sing it sister .

well what 's to be said ? he did n't remember you .
i know .
yeah i know .
yeah you wrote a good piece on the himalayan walking shoe .

howbout this come one down to leaping parry 's if you can beat our prices we 'll give you the store .
no i do n't .
my foot 's asleep again .
you know what ? i 'll be with you in a minute .
larry wait you do n't understand .
i did n't do it on purpose my foot fell asleep .
ya know the guy has one leg and he still calls himself leaping larry you 'd think he had a sense of humor about it .
yup .
wow the whole building burned down .
of course .
the amazing thing is you never have any place to go .
we 're going to meet elaine and peterman at the chinese place .
of course not if i did would you have gone ?
there you go .

no why ?
oh yeah i know .

ah actually i ka kinda had some things to do .
ah just you know i do n't know . stuff i got to do .

that has nothing to do with it .
i i love that george .
so you want to catch a movie later ?

look ramon about the other day . i 'm sorry if i offended you . i get a little crabby on the subway .
what happened to all the towels ?
it 's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days . he 's really been making things uncomfortable for me . there 's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker
and then when i come out of the pool my towel 's always gone .
tell me about it .
you 're meeting susan for lunch at the coffee shop ?
i 'm meeting george for lunch at the coffee shop .
ah you know . i 'm supposed to meet eh someone i 'll i 'll wait for them outside .
this is going to to be ugly .
i said boy am i ugly .
we 'll pull up another chair .
i see you there ramon .
hey l 'll just keep swimming . hey hey . i 'm not done . i know what you 're up to ramon . because i 'm a member here this is my place to swim .
hey you better cut it out ramon . just stop it .

i think he 's going to need mouth to mouth resuscitation .
yeah .
well ? go ahead .
you knocked him out .
come on newman . do it .
he might die .
so eventually these people came and somebody gave him mouth to mouth .
yeah it was a gamble .
ah .
oh i ca n't . they revoked my membership . newman too . you know we ca n't go anywhere near there .
i ca n't figure out what 's going on here . i ca n't follow the plot . why did they kill that guy ? i thought he was with them ?
what is he doing in the chunnel ?
wha 'd you think susan ?
yeah .
it 's hard enough living next door .
yeah .
yep . since college . hey lena small 's on this list .
yeah that girl i was going to call for a date she was unlisted and now here 's her number .
elaine you should admire me i 'm aspiring to date a giving person .
that 's why i should date a giving person . if i date a taking person everyone 's taking taking taking no one 's giving it 's bedlam .
oh i 'll tell her i met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me .
i really did n't pay much attention i 'd just come from buying a speedboat .
see we 're already off the subject of how i got her number . all i got to do is get past the first phone call and i 'm home free .
so if billy had gotten your number off the aids walk list you would n't have gone out with him ?
yeah . so you really like this guy .
how 's the sexual chemistry ?
hello lena ? hi it 's jerry seinfeld . how did i get your number ? i met a guy that knows you he gave it to me i do n't remember his name . think it began with a w maybe a q . i was n't paying that much attention i 'd just come from shopping for a speedboat
hey . what 's the matter ?
what about ?
i got a date with that girl lena .
i actually met her a few weeks ago but
i did n't call her till today .
what ?
i dunno . hey .
so what are you going to do ?
what are you all out of breath from ?
and you got the aids walk tomorrow . you 're never going to make it you 're in horrible shape .
i got a NUM waist mister .
what am i doing ? i 'm dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers .
hey i have found the best smelling detergent . lena smell my shirt .
it 's all tempa cheer .
they serve soup at NUM a . m . ?
do the bums ever complain ? soup again ? '
how could you not ?
so let me ask you something these people eat soup three times a day ?
is it a lot of cream soups ?
why 'd you have to mention unlisted number ?
alright i got to tell you something but you cannot tell susan .
kramer what the hell is going on in there ?
are you out of your mind ? you got the aids walk tomorrow .
you 're never going to make it .
how 'd you find out ?
george .
nothing . listen i 'm sorry i just
you do n't mind that i got your number off the aids walk list ?
you went all night ?
kramer are you out of your mind ? you got the aids walk in like three hours . you 're never going to make it .
so george guess what ? lena found out how i got her number .
a friend of a friend of susan 's .
why 'd you tell her ? .
well you know what this means do n't you ?
you 're cut off you 're out of the loop .
you leave me no choice . you 're the media now as far as i 'm concerned .
if you were in the mafia would you tell her every time you killed someone ?
i do n't know george .
you know what ? that was the amazing thing .
no she said it was fine . there 's something very strange about this girl .
she 's too good .
i mean she 's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others i ca n't be with someone like that .
i mean i admire the hell out of her . you ca n't have sex with someone you admire .
no depravity . i mean i look at her i ca n't imagine she even has sex .
on the other hand
i thought you said it was imminent .
sponge worthy ?
but you like this guy is n't that what the sponges are for ?
hi .
oh the shut ins that 's nice . you know they 're a very eccentric group . because they 're shut in . of course they 're not locked in they 're free to go at anytime .
hey that 's dynamite . you know lena i wanted to talk to you about something you know because you 're such a good person
oh ok
what ? nothing .
oh
tell you something i do .
oh uh you see these jeans i 'm wearing ?
i change the NUM waist on the label to a NUM on all my jeans . so you know . that 's it .
it completely turned her off .
i do n't want to be a NUM .
she said i was n't sponge worthy . would n't waste a sponge on me .
it 's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind .
oh i told him he 'd never make it . he was up all night . oh my god kramer ?
look at you . i told you . up all night playing poker . come on .
to the right .
do n't get up .
since my grandfather died . i was suppose to send it down to my parents in florida but they did n't want it . they told me to get rid of it but i felt funny and then i sort of forgot about it . and it 's been sitting down there for three years until he saw it . all right so just take what you want and let 's get it out of here .
grandpa clothes i ca n't wear em .
no go ahead . look at this place . i ca n't wait to get it cleaned .
no elaine 's got this writer friend from finland rava . her boyfriend goes to columbia grad school and he 's suppose to do it .
how long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation ?
what ?
spread out spread out you numbskulls . why do n't you just settle it like mature adults ?
inka dink a bottle of ink the cork fell out and you stink .
not because you 're dirty not because you 're clean just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine
and you are it .
no he 's it . he wins . it is good .
no no no come on kramer . now you got the socks .
all right c 'mon . let 's go .
come on let 's go .

the inka dink you were it .
it 's very bad .
so where 's this boyfriend of yours ? i ca n't wait much longer . i 've got a flight .
so what do you write children 's books ?
all right
i got to get to the airport .
the uh toilet brush is under the sink .
i do n't really feel that comfortable with a maid either because there 's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house . you know you 're sitting there on your sofa and they go by with the vacuum i 'm really sorry about this . i do n't know why i left that stuff over there . and that 's why i could never be a maid because i 'd have an attitude . i 'd find them wherever they are in the house oh i suppose you could n't do this ? no do n't get up let me clean up your filth . no you could n't dust . no this is too tough is n't it ? '
he really did an amazing job . look . he uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid . he cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups . come here look at this . he cleaned the little one inch area between the refrigerator and the counter . how did he get in there ? . he must be like rubber man .
why did i think there was a rubber man ? there 's elastic man plastic man
where are you going ?
oh wait . i 'll go with you .
elaine he windexed the little peep hole .
hey ray listen you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment .

i think that 's the statue from my house . that looks like the statue from my house .
i had a statue .
my grandfather gave me a statue .
what 's the difference ? . that 's the one . he ripped me off . this guy ripped me off .
i ca n't believe it . this guy ripped me off .
yes . this guy ripped me off . he stole that statue right out of my house .
pretty sure . ninety nine percent sure .
coincidence ? this guy 's in my apartment and then just by coincidence he has the same exact statue in his apartment ?
i had a statue . what should i do ?
i 'll call kramer . he can check my house .

i 'll call him . hello ray ? hi ray this is rava 's friend elaine 's friend jerry the king of comedy right . listen you know that statue on your mantle the one with the blue lady ? would you shut up ? . yeah you do n't want to talk about it over the phone ? you do n't want rava to hear ? yeah i understand you know that coffee shop near my house monk 's ? all right tomorrow one o clock great okay bye .

i know finland . they 're neutral .
no i actually find you quite charming . a bit verbose at times

i said luss . i 'm at a luss .
that 's not necessary . you know maybe it 's not that bad an idea .
george
george george
hey ray .
how did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid ? it was like a brand new nozzle .
really ?
ca n't you talk to your boss ?
well perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice
all right all right . what 's the big hubbub bub ?
kramer what did you do ?
people are going to steal from you . you ca n't stop them . but everybody has their own little personal security things . things that they think will foil the crooks you know ? in your own mind right ? you go to the beach go in the water put your wallet in the sneaker who 's going to know ? what criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security ? i tied a bow . they ca n't get through that . i put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker . they never look there . they check the heel they move on .
who ?
ruthie cohen ?
sure .
maybe that 's why she 's happy .
what is this ?
that stinky old movie house ?
geoffrey who ?
i thought he screwed up the dinkins campaign .
oh then i 'm not worried .
lloyd .
that 's an interesting package .
mmm different . where 'd you get it ?
nah do n't bother .
i do n't want it .
alright .
i think i finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum . it 's a little lo mein y .
it 's chinese gum lloyd braun gave me .
you know i remember when we parted company i was babbling incoherently for months .
and in the end lloyd braun became more like you .
are n't you coming with us to spartacus ?
i thought your parents were outta town ?
oh can lloyd really do that ?
we 're all the way in the front row . why could n't we sit in the special seats ?
nah you do n't want to be uncomfortable .
i do n't know what i was thinking .
errh .
well what 's this for ?
so what ?
aw c 'mon kramer this is ridiculous . i 'm not going to put these on .
ah lloyd .
oh the gum .
uh alright .
well lloydo s a very industrious fellow . i 'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to .
s not necessary .
i know that kramer .
yes i do kramer .
i did n't see anything .
so you say she was on a horse ?
well here 's what i propose . go down to the stables snoop around . see if any high flying cashier 's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips .
well if it is n't chesty la rue .
i was chewing gum with lloyd braun and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the alex .
maybe it 's in the lost and found .
you know the way you were wolfing down that popcorn maybe you ate it .
alright i 'm here . where 's braun ?
look i 'll go downtown to chinatown with him but that is it .
why ?
aw these are really strong glasses .
yeah yeah .
absolutely . let 's just stick around .
lloyd ?
lloyd ?
alright .
here .
got all this ?
i gave you a hundred dollars ? .
it 's a lotta gum .
maybe he 'll write a song about you .
so i take it he 's spongeworthy ?
well he 's a musician . i guess they 're supposed to be very you know uninhibited and free .
oh no ?
come on . come on .
elaine you 're among friends .
oh .
yes it is . it is surprising . does that bother you ?
sure . why not ? you 're there .
but you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship . maybe he 's you know still kind of he not going to happen .
what stuff ?
all right . what are you outta your mind ? look at this . what did you buy here ? you will never be able to finish all this stuff .
a four pound can of black olives ? that 's a staple ?
a forty eight pack of eggo waffles ? a gallon of barbecue sauce ? ten pounds of cocktail meatballs ?
look look at this can of tuna .
this is n't for a person . this is for biosphere NUM .
hi .
john germaine ? that is amazing . i was just talking about him upstairs with elaine .
oh yeah . my friend elaine and him are going out . they 're pretty hot and heavy .
hey you 'll never guess who i bumped into . this guy clyde . he 's in your friend john germaine 's band there .
nothing . i told him you two were pretty hot and heavy .
yeah .
what ?
oh
well clyde might not tell him .
i should have helped kramer with those packages .
he stole back the rye ?
why ?
so do the ross 's know ?

i just got the most bizarre message from you father steinbrenner is at you house they think you 're dead .

yeah yeah i did n't know what to do so i put it back at the stadium . oh wait a second wait a second they saw the car they saw the blood they could n't find ya that 's why steinbrenner thinks you 're dead .
well you got to call your parents .

i do n't remember .
i do n't know . maybe .
alright alright i saw her .
and she was beautiful in that bra . i 'm crazy about her . i love her whole free swinging free wheeling attitude .
boy i miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid .
yeah i 'm right there with ya .
huh ?
oh yeah be great for your paper route .
you know the only way to really help her is to just let her be .
you 're really going to town with that turkey there .
it 's on the door .
hey hey . wha wait what you 're going to leave it there ? that 's like half a pound of turkey .
yeah you 're right . i really should keep more of your favourites on hand .
what arrangement ?
yeah well lemme know when you get something in there and i will .
hey . what 's with your neck ?
well if it 's any consolation i did get her number .
aw i doubt you strained it . maybe you pulled it .
did you twist it ? you coulda twisted it .
did you wrench it ? did you jam it ? maybe you squeezed it . turned it
awright .
what 's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics .
i dunno . oh cos you said you 'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck .
oh yeah .
well that 's the most he 's worked in the last four months .
seven ? yeah i guess i could see it . seven . seven periods of school seven beatings a day . roughly seven stitches a beating and eventually seven years to life . yeah you 're doing that child quite a service .
awright let 's see . how about mug ? mug costanza that 's original . or uh ketchup ? pretty name for a girl .
i got fifty right here in the cupboard . how about bisquik ? pimento . gherkin . sauce . maxwell house .
oh i forgot to call christie .
yeah she had this great black and white dress with a scoop neck . she looked like some kinda superhero .
i 'm not engaged .
got what ?
oh it 's no problem . you can take whatever you want .
sort of a mooching inventory .
alright .
kramer i do n't know if you 're getting that bike .
well this is it . the food is atrocious but the busboys are the best in the city .
the exact same outfit .
three .
possibly but then should n't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle ?
why ? it 's our first date she 's already in reruns ?
indeed .
well if she splits the atom i 'll let it slide .
hey did susan change her mind about the name ?
you know george just because your life is destroyed do n't destroy someone else 's .
how about mickey ?
hey is this your half a can of soda in the fridge ?
what ?
you cannot buy half a can of soda .
well i do n't want to get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here but you know the sound a can makes when you open it ?
that is the sound of you buying a whole can . and the same goes for this okay
when you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit you 've bought the whole fruit . not a third of an apple not a half of a banana
you bite it you bought it .
thank you .
hey
have n't seen him . how 's the neck ?
boy i 'm surprised . i would think kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person 's spine around .
you saw her ? what was she wearing ?
did n't you get a glimpse ? an impression ?
both times i 've seen her she 's worn the same dress .
well i 'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom but unfortunately my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved . what you need is an impartial mediator .
course it would have to be someone who has n't heard the story before . someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment . someone whose heart is so dark it cannot be swayed by pity compassion or human emotion of any kind .
no i 'm just a little uh worn out .
oh i 'm sure you do .
what in godo s name is going on here ? is she wearing the same thing over and over again ? or does she have a closet full of these like superman ? i 've got to unlock this mystery .
oh .
change ? yes i think that 's a super idea .
ah so this is the fortress of solitude .
yes change . by all means change .
august seventeen nineteen ninety two . the same dress . she never changes . oh my god . she 's got to have hundreds of these dresses .
there must be a secret stash around here somewhere .
what 're you doing ? i thought you were changing .
no no . c 'mon put something else on . it 's early let 's go out .
you know i 'm kinda tired myself . maybe i 'll just sleep here on the couch . then in the morning you 'll get dressed we 'll walk out together . both dressed different clothes . well i 'll be in the same clothes . you 'll of course be in different clothes because it 's your apartment . but we 'll go downstairs me in my same clothes you in your different clothes .
you want to throw something on and walk me to a cab ?
tell me what you 're wearing tomorrow . i 'll help you lay it out on the bed .
hello christie ? i was wondering if we could get together again ? oh really ? well you ca n't break up with me over the phone . c 'mon you got to do this in person . it does n't even have to be one on one you can bring a group of friends . i just want to see you . wait do n't hang up on me . why do you wear the same dress all the time ? hello .
alright hobo joe . i did n't want to put a damper on your little smorgasbord here but it 's the end of the week so i added up your tab .
i know . pretty steep .
few do .
yeah well until this bill is paid
the food court is closed .

i killed .
slaughtered . wiped the floor with em and not only that the money was unbelievable .

maybe a cadillac .
yeah . that would really blow his mind . he 's always wanted one his whole life he 's never been able to afford it . i 'm going to do it .
oh is n't that what it 's all about ?
i want this baby fully loaded . well how soon can you get it there ? oh that 's terrific . okay thanks bye .

hey george you coming to the tonight show on thursday ?
yeah sure . my parents will be there .
yeah they 're in town this week you want to go ?
no .
no he 's doing mine next . they 're low flow you know .
well they were humiliated . i mean after the impeachment my father left office in disgrace .
well this is the problem . they 're moving into this new development . here 's the pamphlet . del boca vista . but they 're not quite ready to go back so they 're in seclusion here for a while at uncle leo 's .
no leo 's not there . he 's got a girlfriend lydia . in fact he moved in with her .
yeah i know . it devalues the whole thing .
hello ?
you got to be there at NUM NUM .
yeah well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at NUM NUM .
NUM years .
all right i 'll see you later .
yeah it is .
no economic reason for them to be here .
no social reason for them to be here .
i do n't know maybe get an ice tray ?
you know dad just called me .
yeah all right well i got some people here .
all right bye . you see this ? any thought pops into their head they 're calling me because it 's a local call now .
i 'm used to a NUM mile buffer zone . i ca n't handle this . plus i got the dinners i got the pop ins . they pop in . it 's brutal .
the only way out of this is if leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to florida .
once a week ? so how 's lydia ?
i do n't know how you do it .
a man like you limiting yourself to one woman i do n't know . but it 's none of my business .
well
hey it happens .
he has no idea who you are .
all right . anyway the point i was making before goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger . c 'mon uncle leo i 've seen the way women look at you . when 's the last time you looked in a mirror ? you 're an adonis . you 've got beautiful features lovely skin you 're in the prime of your life here you should be swinging . if i were you i 'd tell this lydia character it 's been real move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign open for business .
well keep looking .
yeah .
me either .
you ? what about me ? i got the tonight show tonight . i 'm going to have to shower in the dressing room .
where are you going ?
there 's more food down the hall .
oh hi .
actually i 'm drunk .
i know this does n't seem like work to any of you if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall i could just get a little personal space .
yeah i got some family backstage . course my family 's nuts they 're crazy . yep . my uncle leo i had lunch with him the other day he 's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life he blames it on anti semitism . you know what i mean the spaghetti 's not al dente ? cook 's an anti semite . loses a bet on a horse . secretariat ? anti semitic . does n't get a good seat at the temple . rabbi ? anti semite .
hey listen to this uncle leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit i did . she thought it was funny so he accused her of being an anti semite . they had a huge fight and now he 's moving back into his apartment . you know what this means my parents are going to go back to florida what ? what number is this ? oh i 'm terribly sorry .
hey kramer my parents are going to have to move back to florida is n't that great ?
hey you 're not giving it to me man . what 's wrong ?
no good ?
well you used to sit in that hot tub ?
chicken ?
poppy seeds .
hello newman .
not from the footage i 've seen .
what 's going on ?
are you kidding ?
where are they moving to ?
del boca vista that 's where my parents are going to live .
we could visit together .
that 's incredible .
why ?
to spite my parents ?
your parents are crazy .
my parents are moving back too .
you have no idea how your life is going to improve as a result of this . food tastes better . the air seems fresher . you 'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of .
hello .
oh hi dad .
nothing . a bottle broke . that 's all . what do you mean you 're going to move in here ?
but it 's a big complex .
all right fine . come over here .
they 're not going back to florida . they 're moving here .
because your parents are going down there . my buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet . you got to do something .
you know what you 're doing do n't you ? you 're killing independent jerry . i got to go see my uncle leo . i think he may have made a big mistake .
c 'mon you 're lucky to have anybody .
swinging ? what are you out of your mind ? look at you you 're disgusting . you 're bald you 're paunchy all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty four hours a day . if there 's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds you should hang on to her like grim death . which is not far off by the way .
can you blame her ?
what do you recommend ?
well it 's been a great visit .
well at least the costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move . they could n't bear being away from george .
you have no idea .
thank you . goodnight .
hey . hey .
right oh i 'm sorry . uh oh so you saw the show ?
oh thanks .
i believe you .
oh i 'm sorry i ca n't i 'm going straight to the airport .
oh ?
uh huh .
uh well you better not . i 'm supposed to be careful with it .
oh okay
ohh look at this
i bought a bottle of bbq sauce in memphis . i think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
i do n't care about the sauce . it came in this funny little bottle and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like charles grodin .
no you do n't see because i 'm going on the show this week and this was going to be my bit on the show .
i 'm out .
thanks for the tip .
hey . hey this is for you . it 's from uh susan 's roommate sally .
nobody hit anything off . she just gave me the box . what the hell are you doing ?
hey hey hey . come on come on .
like what ?
where 's the punchline ?
a door mat ? that 's what she had me lug up from memphis ? .
federal express ? . is she out of her mind ? why did n't she just ship it ? .
hey elaine you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush i just got the ori dent .
oh it 's unbelievable . every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist .
hey what are you doing tomorrow ? you want to come see me on the charles grodin show ?
uh one of the three tenors .
uh it 's not poverotti it 's not domingo
yeah the other guy .
why ?
why not ?
hey you look awful .
problem in the bedroom ?
wow . you were in bed with your mother last night ?
i thought you did n't want the doormat .
sally ? wait wait a minute she 's coming to new york ?
excited ? i 'm going to kill her . she knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box ? .
it 's because of her that bottle got broke that i was going to give to charles grodin on his show .
i will do n't worry . in fact i 'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff . it 'll be really heavy . let 's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap .
hey . a dinosaur .
well it does n't look exactly like her .
why do n't you just get rid of it ?
wait where are you going ? do n't take your dolly and go home .
i 'm just glad it 's outta here . what 's that ?
oh . yeah ?
oh did you bring the bar b que sauce ?
excellent . so did you buy that electric toothbrush i was telling you about ?
how come ? i told you it 's fantastic .
i 've had yours i 'm telling you this one is ten times better . do n't you believe me ?
i do n't understand this . why would n't you want to get something that 's better if i 'm telling you it 's better ? and it 's not a little better it 's much better .
come in .
oh hi . elaine this is sally .
how was your flight ? pretty uncomfortable ?
oh oh wait this is n't the sauce that i asked for .
no no . i wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like charles grodin .
i know it 's a joke . it 's supposed to be a joke . now i 'm going on the charles grodin show with nothing . nothing .
i do n't have any material .
that woman is such an idiot . i was going to do this whole bit on that bottle and now i got nothing to talk about .
well maybe if i did n't have so many people in my apartment all the time i 'd be able to get some work done .
no . you 're never here .
yeah . really . hey you know what ? maybe i could talk about that on the show .
show the doll show the picture of george 's mother it 's pretty funny . i 'm going to call them .
hello susan ? it 's jerry .
oh . is george there ?
uh listen this is important . tell him to meet me at the tv studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her .
yes .
hey .

well that 's one hell of a gig . hey look i got something for you . the ori dent .
well it 's a delicate mechanism it you know needs lots of packaging .

really i 'll be back .
so i did n't like the crest all that much . but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store i told i wanted to see what someone else thought and then he makes a face like he does n't believe me .
yeah he caught me so here 's what i want you to do . come back with me to the store and we 'll pretend to look at the coat .
because he thinks i was lying and i want to show him i was n't .
but if you go back with me then i 'm not .
problems with the house guest ?
boy imagine liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice .

yeah well elaine .
hey elaine what about the crest . ? what do you think of the crest here .
you what ?
check .
you were n't supposed to say that .
that 's not the point . you put me in a position where i had no choice .
and what about that guy asking you out right in front of me ?
s very emasculating he does n't know the nature of our relationship . you 're there approving new clothes that 's a girlfriend job . how dare he .
no i gave it back to you

it 's been known to happen telling you right now elaine this guy s going to dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule .
like a shark fisherman with a bucket of ch
like a shrimp farmer
you know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on elaine right in front of me . he stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like . you know what i 'm going to do . ? i 'm going to take that jacket back i 'm putting this guy right out of commission
turn in ?
it 's only nine o clock .
i ca n't go to sleep at nine o clock .
hey look you know you 're the one who 's locked out . i 'm letting you stay here . you 're wearing my bathrobe . you should adapt to me .
oh why do n't you go sleep over at newman 's .
well that 's all i got .
huh ?
kramer there 's no way you 're sleeping with me .
why ?
do i really have to explain why ?
yeah why ?
so who is he ?
do n't you see ? it 's all a big scam .
excuse me i 'd like to return this jacket .
for spite
that 's right . i do n't care for the salesman that sold it to me .
what do you mean ?
that 's ridiculous i want to return it . what 's the difference what the reason is .
well i want to return this jacket and she asked me why and i said for spite and now she wo n't take it back .
but i changed my mind
oh . hey .
hey you 're staying with my friend george .
well he does n't even want himself there .
all right .
they make wigs out of human hairs ?
bye .
guess so .
hello
excuse me excuse me are you asking him out ?
right in front of me . . how do you know we 're not together . two guys sitting laughing drinking champagne coolies .
well we 're sitting here together . why would n't you think that .
well it 's very emasculating
hey .
well what 'd you say ?
what 's his problem ?
he called the right guy .
all right i 'm leaving . i going to the laundry .
fluff and fold . the only way to live . i drop it off . i pick it up . it 's a delight .
wait a sec . i do n't want to do
i do n't want to mix in everything . my guys do n't know your guys . you ca n't just lock em all in the same machine together . they 'll start a riot .
no . i ca n't say as i have .
all right . put em on top .
oh beautiful .
this stuff on top is my friends . could i get it done in a separate machine ?
whatever it costs . in fact i would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other . because something could you know jump across .
how did you know i was here ?
i do n't know .
get outta here .
what happened ? levitan ?
you and your toilets .
so what are you going to do now ? are you going to look for something else in real estate ?
so what are you going to do ?
uh huh . uh huh . in what capacity ?
yeah . well that that could be tough to get .
yeah . yeah . you make good comments .
well they tend to give those jobs to ex ballplayers and people that are you know in broadcasting .
i know . well okay . okay . what else do ya like ?
yeah . yeah .
projectionists .
but you got to know how to work the projector .
and it 's probably a union thing .
talk show host . that 's good .
really ?
well that 's where it gets tricky .
i would n't think so .
all right . okay . sports movies talk show host . what else ?
well it does n't sound like you completely thought this through .
maybe you can just go back .
yeah . pretend like it never happened .
sure . you 're an emotional person . people do n't take you seriously .
never happened .
so what ? you 're entitled .
that 's right . you 're emotional .
never happened .
to me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that i did work in an office . is that when you go in in the morning you say hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them . i mean you walk in morning bill morning bob how you doing ? fine ten minutes later you see him in the hall how ya doin ? every time you pass you got to come up with another little greeting . you know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow hey you start coming up with nicknames for them . jimbo . '
well so that 's that .
that 's not that ?
well if that 's not that what is that ?
what kind of plans ?
you do n't want to tell me ?
what ? in his drink ? are you outta your mind ? what are you peter lorre ?
what if you destroy him ?
well wha what does that do ? big deal .
you 've really gone mental .
where are you going to get this mickey ? i ca n't believe i 'm saying mickey' .
you got a mickey source ?
elaine ? how did you rope her into this ?
she knew that .
what is the point of all this ?
oh the best revenge is living well .
did you get your laundry ?
what 's with you ?
what ?
did he call you last night ?
what did you say ?
whew . did he wave ?
oh my god .
well on thursday when i came home i had $NUM on me . for some reason i decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then i completely forgot about it and then i took the laundry in on friday . oh come on let 's go .
to the laundromat .
oh i see . so you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want ? you 're not a part of society .
so anybody leaves anything here you can just take it ? you have a license to steal ? you are like the james bond of laundry ?
come on . let 's go .
maybe we should call this off .
and what 's going to happen ?
if only you could put your mind to something worthwhile . you 're like lex luthor .
what about the gentle cycle ? you ever use that ?
do you think it 's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle ?
what about fine fabrics ? how do you deal with that kind of temperament ?
what about stone washing ? you ever witness one of those ? that must be something . what ? do they just pummel the jeans with rocks ?
yeah . that 's true .
what ? my god the money . the NUM . where 'd you find it ?
in your laundry the whole time ? i told you not to mix in our guys . what did we figure the damage on that machine would be ?
elaine come on take a walk with me down to the laundromat . i got to pay this guy the money
people like the idea of revenge . have you ever heard the expression the best revenge is living well i 've said this in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life . sounds nice does n't really work on that charles bronson . kinda level . you know what i mean those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum . you think you could go up to him charlie forgot about the NUM what you need is a custom made suit and a convertible . new carpeting french doors a divan . that 'll show those punks . '
what bet ?
dustin hoffman in star wars . ? . short jewish guy against darth vader . i do n't think so .
so the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner ?
huh .
no . nothing .
what 's with you ?
wow . that 's hot .
so know every time you get dressed . you are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer .
i got a date with nikki .
she 's also quite bold .
hey elaine .
this is nikki .
oh of course . todd gack . you did you bet was in star wars ? sammy davis jr .
why do n't you see what you can do ?
we 'll see .
yeah . why ?
hey that might be a nice idea for george 's wedding .
sure . if there cheap why not .
told you .
all right . enjoy'blame it on the rain'
there really building a utopian society up there huh . and you tribute all this to the calzone .
with you two guys at the helm . the last piece of the puzzle is in place .
so you do n't make it a habit of giving to the blind .
so george . remember when i told you nikki gets whatever she wants . we are at the movies last night . it 's sold out . nikki goes and talks to the manager . right in .
she 's like a beautiful godzilla .
what the hell is all this ?
why ca n't you do this on your table ?
hey . so how was'blame it on the rain ? '
oh . let me ask you a question . was the movie part of the bet ?
you know elaine it is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends
absolutely . but i feel i must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet .
come on . dustin hoffman in star wars . he made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
because if he does n't ask you out he does n't get rejected . he has found a dating loop hole .
so what happened after the movie ?
to the door ?
that 's a date .
but i never walk you home .
no no .
so how did you leave it with him ?
that 's another loop hole . that 's two dates without asking you out .
crazy like a man .
i was got to be NUM .
a lot faster than that .
okay dokey
absolutely . nikki .
would you mind bringing the officer the registration ?
you must have gotten me when i slowed down to take that curve because for a while there i was doing well over NUM .
all right nik . that 's it .
you got your shirt in my oven . ? .
for both of us .
what 's wrong with your oven ?
yeah .
come on up .
i got some cubans for george 's wedding . they were more than i wanted to pay for but what the hell .
peru . i paid $NUM bucks for these . i could have bought a house in peru for $NUM bucks .
i got to pay this todd gack guy $NUM bucks just so he has some excuse to see elaine again without asking her out .
so what is steinbrenner going to do if he does n't get his calzones ?
why do n't you get someone else from the office to go get pisano 's for you ?
no . i never had a job .
kramer 's cooking up some corduroy .
what kind of pie are you cooking ?
i did .
well what could i do ? unless you pay him a visit .
stupid cigars . you know if i did n't send nikki over to talk to him they would n't be together .
it 's like trying to smoke a chicken bone .
i think it 's dutch . i got to get going .
i uh promised nikki that i 'd walk her dog for her .
i know i know . but some how she explained it to me and i could n't say no .
oh .
actually it 's being taken care of right now .
he pulled an lbj on you .
lyndon johnson used to do that to his staffers .
oh yeah . he 'd hold national security meetings in there . he planned the hanoi bombing after a bad thai meal .
ask him to repeat it . tell him there was an echo in there .
you know what you do ? ask him a follow up question . tell him you 're having trouble getting started and you want his advice .
hey .
can i have my keys
back please ?
well what do you think the hoboes are doing ?
no i ca n't . i got to pick up elaine . i 'm taking her to this kennedy auction .
hey you 're not talking that michigan deposit bottle scam again are you ?

ehh i dunno
i 'm so nauseous . she 's the worst driver .
i 'm so car sick . i 'm going to vomit .
huh ?
i do n't know but we do n't have much time .
the city 's probably teeming with people who 've been waiting out that marriage .
it 's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building you got to take immediate action .
their grieving time is a luxury i ca n't afford . i 'm calling beth tonight and if you want a clean shot at david i suggest you do likewise .
but we got to make it seem like we 're not calling for dates .
good question . why are we calling ?
i 'm there for you . '
hey remember beth and david from yesterday ? they got separated .
what 'd you say ?
hey uh what 'd you get there ?
slim fit ?
you 're walking like frankenstein .
sure beth these things happen . so have you told many people yet ?
anyway i just called to tell you that i 'm there for you .
sure dinner would be fine .
what 's wrong ?
alright alright . uh undo them . i 'll help you get them off .
you just got to wiggle your hips a little bit .
alright alright that 's no good . let me try getting them from the bottom . just gimme one leg .
man these are tight . squinch your hips in
squinch em .
alright that 's not going to work it 's not going to work . let me just think for a second here .
hold it hold it look your going to need the jaws of life to get out of those things .
maybe you can soak in the tub .
well i just want you to know i 'm there for you . course now i 'm here for you but when i 'm not here for you i 'm there for you .
so how did this all happen ?
is that right ?
maybe maybe
well three years is a long time to be married .
i 'll tell you that there for you crap was a stroke of genius .
never mind
you 're a genius .
what 's going on ? you 're the man of the hour that 's what 's going on .
according to them
where are you going ?

anyway beth you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was NUM . i wanted these handball sneakers they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers .
i 'm nauseous .
a little
it 's not bad .
it 's got to have something to do with kramer

why do n't you just break it off with her . tell her it 's over
why not ?
all right take it easy just take it easy .
a letter .
that 's it ?
you ca n't go to china what about your job ?
so write a letter move to another move to staten island . lot easier to blend in a sea of people in staten island than china believe me .
aagh . you come back for your clothes
so forget about your clothes .
look freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes .
and what hope for a crash ?
you know what the odds are on a crash it 's a million to one .
euhh elaine
hey elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . what could he do ?
does she hate cigarettes ?
but you do n't smoke .
you know i think i 'm getting a little depressed about george 's wedding .
yeah . well once he gets married that 's it she 'll probably get pregnant they 'll move to westchester . i 'll never see him again .
then it 'll just be me you and kramer .
so it 's just going to be me and kramer .
see you me and kramer
how you going to drive when looking through a periscope ? besides it 's not a submarine and there 's no room for a periscope in a car .

the coffeeshop ?

who wants two ? special sneak preview of death blow .
kramer do you know what i had to go through to get these ?
yeah i guess i do owe you .
no i 'm okay .
i 'm fine . how was the party ?
yeah so i did n't miss anything ?
elaine danced ?
did she do the little kicks and the thumbs ?
for some time it was about five years ago . i never knew what to say to her about it . it was one of those problems i hoped would just go away .
and by then you 've lost interest .
what made him get that thing ?
not a very long trip .
i do n't even have the extra ticket yet .
how could that be ?
no george was there he said he had a great time .
oh what are you talking about ?
now you 're talking crazy .
oh there 's my call waiting i got to get going .
really ? i thought you were rebuffed .
maybe elaine put in a good word for you .
interesting . she does n't care for you then a stern warning suddenly a phone call . seems elaine 's made you the bad boy . and anna digs the bad boy .
you 've been the bad employee the bad son the bad friend
the bad fianc&eacute &macNUM the bad dinner guest the bad credit risk
the bad date the bad sport the bad citizen the bad tipper .
half of show business is here .
that 's quite a feed bag you 're working on there .
i 'm a joke maker .
hey hey what the hell is he doing ?
does what ?
may i see you outside for a moment please ?
outside .
what do you mean he 's bootlegging the movie ?
it 's not legitimate .
where did you meet this guy ?
kramer .
i do n't believe this .
hey what is going on over there ?
are you nuts ? there 's no way i 'm holding that thing .
yeah well maybe if he did n't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we wouldo ve eaten some . serves him right .
all right i 'm i m taking the camera .
oh man
how was the rest of death blow ?
kramer you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point .
you know he came by here at NUM o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape . i was scared out of my mind .
what are you crazy ? i do n't want to see this guy again .
what if i did n't do it right ?
people with guns do n't understand . that 's why they get guns . too many misunderstandings .
hi .
yeah .
what ?
well i did the best i could .
i do n't want another gig . i 'm not doing this .
we 're talking federal crime here .
no no no no no no no . what were you thinking when you shot this ?
do you even know what this scene is about ?
no bread is his soul . he 's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul .
kramer there is no way you 're giving this tape to brody and telling him i shot it .
i do n't care about brody . i was up on NUM street today there was a kid could n't have been more than ten years old . he was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as death blow . that 's who i care about . the little kid who needs bootlegs because his parent or guardian wo n't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and i take for granted .
i have to . but i 'm going to need to storyboard this whole thing . where are my magic markers ?
i forgot to make my bed .
all right you 're beyond stink .
and that 's not helping either . that 's why you 're having trouble with your staff not because of george .
have you ever seen yourself ? ah ah please please . not in my home . i got to go throw this stuff in the laundry . i 'll be right back .
no i did n't shoot this one . i 'm just scouting the location .
you 'll get your tape . but here 's what i 'm going to need . i 'm going to need three cameras two on the floor one in the balcony . and i want headsets for the guys running em . i want to be able to talk to em .
kramer
all right . that 's it i ca n't work like this .
i 'm off the project .
they think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs .
eh the whole business has changed . it 's all about money now . the sad thing is it 's the kids that suffer .
kramer i 'm not doing this anymore . i do n't know what i was thinking . it 's illegal it 's dangerous
what ?
oh now i see . yeah .
what 're we going to do ?
i think that 's it . sweet fancy moses .
uh well . it uh
uh great .
yeah out of nowhere there 's this lone dancer who appears to be injured .
yeah so you cry and when you see the dancing you cry again .
but he 's an old man elaine .
hey it 's the bootlegged death blow that i shot .
no you do n't .
yeah .
thank you .
i 'm still big . it 's the bootlegs that got small . so how are things at the office ? back to normal ?
i would n't worry about it .
no . all you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver .
what are you doing ?
extra teeth . i love that look .
what mustard stain ?
why did you take a picture of a mustard stain ?
i see . she 's looking .
they 've tried to fix it . but it keeps coming back the same .
well i ca n't the warranty expired two years ago .
well how are you going
i guess i would .
not the gown again .
they have gotten to know you .
why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys .
yeah .
who 's it from ?
what if i do n't want it ?
maybe i am .
i 've never done it before .
why not ?
i do n't know it was weird . crazy printing . i do n't know who it was from .
it 's not totally impossible .
why ca n't i be bombable ?
i suppose you think your bombable .
there 's more than a couple .
you do n't have a mercedes .
the driver seems a little put out .
is that burt reynolds ?
oh .
that 's a lot of skin .
you can barely see her face .
where are you going ?
oh yeah i like this idea .
hey
he went to get some steak sauce . why ?
hello
hello leo . you do n't have to yell .
how did you get my package ?
i do n't know what you should do with it .
i am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot .
open the package leo .
opening .
no no bomb .
oh stupid leo was using one of those oven cleaners . he left the canister in there and the pilot light was on . the whole thing blew up .
yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows mustache everything . he 's all smooth now . look 's like a seal .
is this my stereo ?
what happened to my stereo ? it 's all smashed up .
but you were supposed to get me a refund .
so were going to make the post office pay for my new stereo ?
how is it a write off ?

you do n't even know what a write off is .
no . i do n't .
i wish i just had the last twenty seconds of my life back .

there 's no zorn or zoutraph .
hey what about dr . resnick my uncle leo is going to see him tomorrow .

oh my god .
i have some questions of my own .
the timeless art of seduction .
what have i done ? i ca n't read this . ful hel mo nen ter val ? i got up last night i wrote this down i thought i had this great bit .
johnny ? johnny who ? johnny carson ? did i insult johnny on the tonight show ?
i do n't know . that 's like asking where 's waldo ? '
i do n't think that 's it .
what does that mean ?
oh he 's having a heart attack .
c 'mon .
oh this is ridiculous .
i know what this is . you saw that show on pbs last night coronary country . i saw it in the tv guide . i called him and told him to make sure and not watch it .
he saw that show on anorexia last year and ate like an animal for two weeks .
so what do you want ? you want me take you to the hospital ?
i 'll call an ambulance .
well ? what do you think ?
salami salami bologna ?
what a surprise . hey how ya doing buddy ? you need anything ? do you want me to go out and get you a superman comic ?
you know i was wondering you know that black hawks jacket you have ?
well you know i was thinking if things do n't exactly work out
no i tried it on . it fits good .
well you know
oh and do you think it would be alright if i called susan davis ?
well it 's not like we 'd be bumping into you .
you know if your future was a little more certain
well ah what ? kind of like this ?
elaine what are you doing here ?
there 's nothing wrong with him . i saw the doctor . he 's fine .
hey that was really fun george . can we go home now ?
yeah if you 've been exposed to gamma rays .
well it 's like the capulets and the montagues .
women go after doctors like men go after models . they want someone with knowledge of the body we just want the body .
hey .
kramer .
kramer george did n't have a heart attack .
it 's routine surgery .
well for one think do n't listen to him .
eckman ? i thought he was doing time ?
a rebel ? no . johnny yuma was a rebel . eckman is a nut . george you want to take care of your tonsils you do it in a hospital . with a doctor .
george you need a medical doctor .
well an overnight stay in a hospital ? minor surgery ? i dunno four grand .
do n't flatter yourself my friend . i 'm here strictly for material and i have a feeling this is a potential gold mine i still think you 're nuts though .
i 've never had a really good pickle .
sorry .
and you 're not a doctor but you play one in real life .
there 's some hot air blowing in here
too much dairy ? you really think i 'm eating too much dairy ?
i love crampbark .
cleaver i once had cleaver as a kid . i was able to lift a car .
couchgrass and crampbark ? you know i think that 's what killed curly .
excuse me tor . may i ask you a question ? you have intuitive abilities . you 're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things i have this note i ca n't read . i was wondering if
maybe he does n't like them . that 's possible .
i 'll get you a chuckle . you want me to get you a chuckle ?
you 're going to fight ?
really gentlemen please .
all this for a chuckle .
it 's a jelly candy . it comes in five flavors .
you just ca n't leave him out there .
how ya doing ? ca n't talk ? hey how 'd you get the plastic one ? i like that . so how 's life without tonsils ? what ? what 's that ? so how much is this thing going to cost you now ? like five six thousand ? well live and learn at least we lived . kramer went to eckman he feels better alreadyy what are you doing ?
hey check the tv .
that 's it . that 's it . flaming globes of sigmond . flaming globes of sigmond . that 's my note . tha'ts what i thought was so funny ? . that 's not funny there 's nothing funny about that .
i have a friend who 's a hypochondriac always thinks he 's sick never is . and they you have another type of person always thinks they 're well not matter how bad they really are . you know this type of person ? very annoying . feel great like being on the respirator intravenous heartlung machine . i never felt better in my life . medical science is making advances every day in control health problems . in fact it 's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack you know becomes like a head ache . we 'll just see people on tv going i had a heart attack this big but i gave myself one of these . clear . brrhht and it 's gone . '
my friend kramer and i were discussing that same thing the other day . he was with brant leland for a while .
mentor ? you mean your boss .
hmm . so cynthia 's your mentor .
well i like gabe kaplan .
yes . and the mentor advises the prot&eacute g&eacute .
no .
respect admiration prestige .
i suppose if it was on the prot&eacute g&eacute 's way to the mentor they might .
it 's not a valet it 's a prot&eacute g&eacute .
risk management ?
well what makes them think you 're a risk management expert ?
hello ?
so get this book on tape .

lomez is jewish ?
kramer you know i
i 'm not really a duck fan the skin seems sort of human .
hello .
no kidding ?
bania ?
reading for the blind ?
so i finally met the mentor .
oh yeah she 's dating bania .
yeah . i had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen .
chicken how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with bania ?
piccata if anything i should be dating a mentor and bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley .
hey good luck with that .
kramer how are you going to cook jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty three people ?
well if he 's doing that bad maybe he 's in line for another promotion .
what the hell is going on here ?
what are you doing ?
no i do n't want to .
oh this is awful .
did you follow the recipe ?
it tastes like dirt .
kramer you ca n't talk to frank .
yeah it was alright .
no . no no way no bania .
have you seen his act ? he 's got a twelve minute bit about ovaltine . he 's a punk a patsy a hack .
would . does . is .
so you saw bania 's act ?
i told you it 's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges .
he just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny .
no more mentor ?
well at least you and i are okay again .
why ?
i can tell you what to do .
i can tell you what to think .
oh .
kind of in the middle of something here george .
george ?
i ca n't believe you feel you really need a mentor .
yeah see ya .
what 's your problem .
oh hey bania .
oh that 's too bad .
well it 's just that you got so many things with the milk . you got that bosco bit then you got your nestl&eacute 's quik bit by the time you get to ovaltine
george costanza is your mentor ?
about what ? how to calculate five percent of a restaurant check ?
as a matter of fact i happen to have a prot&eacute g&eacute of my own .
a mister kenneth bania .
i 'm going to mentor this kid to the top .
well i do n't think i want to date a prot&eacute g&eacute whose mentor is a costanza .
have you tried the hamentashen ?
bania ?
risk management ?
hey have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs ? pepcid ac tagemat hb .
now you know you 're supposed to take these things before you get sick ?
no .
we 're just talking . is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever ? if you feel good you 're supposed to take one .
they 've opened up a whole new market . medication for the well .
then you admit it was amusing ?
great . thanks .
so when do i meet this jerk ?
who ?
what song ?
desperado ?
and you 're still dating him ? i tell you who sounds a little desperado .
see that salesman twirling that umbrella .
i invented that .
when i started out as a comedian i sold umbrellas . it was my idea to twirl it to attract customers .
elaine .
elaine please it was a long time ago . the man does n't want a history lesson .
i know teddy padillac . i worked with him on forty eighth and sixth .
in his dreams .
by the way you 're doing it too fast . you 'll disorient the customers .
it 's the twirling that dazzles the eye .
those belong to people .
oh no not more checks . they 're coming faster than i can sign em .
i do n't know why . there 's a one second clip of me in the opening credits of some japanese comedy show .
they run it all the time and now i 'm starting to get all these royalty checks .
naw . each one is for like twelve cents . it 's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign em .
why ?
ah who are any of her losers ?
i do it i 'm not even getting the cleaning .
signed over a hundred checks this morning .
i 'm going to ask this guy something .
hey . nice twirl you got there . you know who invented that do n't you ?

no spiel ?
so you 're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you ?
you know maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed ?
too dumb ?
well . mack is back in town . nice duds .
sounds like you 're throwing a lot of their money around .
what kind of show am i going to do in japan ?
forget it . the pilot was awful . it failed .
you had a date ? you went out with my butler ? . who said you could go out with my butler ? .
because he 's my butler .
no . that 's what makes it such a humorous situation .
sorry . my hand is numb .
what does he listen to ? the all desperado station ?

okay . so is there any song that you feel very strongly about ?
witchy woman ?

i 've heard of ohio katie . but tuesday 's no good . i 'm doing career day at my old junior high .

the guy with the lizard .
i 'm getting bumped ? you 're bumping me from career day ?
so you 're enjoying the not enjoying .
i 'm finding that out .
ah i did n't get on . the lizard guy went long .
it was a mix up i 'm sure .
now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head ?
you can make all the laws you want he 's still going to bother people .
no let 's just do it . what ? what is going on ? what is that about ?
but i was promised this slot .
fire drill can you believe that ?
like fire in a school is such a big deal .
middle drawer .
hello ?
oh hi katie .
oh relax katie . it 's not a problem .
no i do n't have any ashtrays .
no katie do n't
is this a repeat ?
louise . that 's what 's doing it . you 're no longer pre occupied with sex so your mind is able to focus .
yeah . i mean let 's say this is your brain . okay from what i know about you your brain consists of two parts the intellect represented here and the part obsessed with sex . now granted you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap . but with no sex louise this previously useless lump is now functioning for the first time in its existence .
what is going on in there ?
why ?
it does n't ?
all right .
hey . wh what 'd you got a smoker 's lounge in there ?
i was out .
an assembly ?
i understand . but what am i going to talk about for two hours ?
superfreak ?
so if you like to tell jokes and love to make people laugh stand up comedy may be the career for you .
how am i going to fill two hours ?
and give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids .
are you all right ?
wait a second i know what 's happening . the no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you .
to a woman sex is like the garbage man . you just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street a guy in a jumpsuit 's going to come along and pick it up . but now it 's like a garbage strike . the bags are piling up in your head . the sidewalk is blocked . nothing 's getting through . you 're stupid .
exactly .
hey .
what ? what happened to your face ? it looks like an old catcher 's mitt .
it 's from all that smoke . you 've experienced a lifetime of smoking in NUM hours . what did you expect ?
and your teeth your teeth are all brown .
so what did you do ?
but ultimately you 're going to choose in favor of sex right ?
you mean not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances .
so you 're never going to have sex again ?
so you ready for the assembly tomorrow ? you know what you 're going to say about the yankees ?
i wrote a NUM minute bit about how homework stinks .
how ya doin ?
well do n't worry about it . once he passes the test you 'll have sex again and you 'll be fine .

i mean your body of work in this field is unparalleled .
you 're the man .
i 'm with people i 'll be with you in a moment . so you want a protein shake or something ?
hello newman .

you never really had the right comeback anyway .
i did n't know it was possible not to know that .
milos i can assure you i had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing .
i guess that 's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade .
well i 'll do it as long as there 's no other girls around . i mean i want to be a man too .
so you hurt vincent 's feelings ?
wh what 's this ?

you really like this girl .

so you put down my money ? .
not that no
george pick up . i know you 're screening for allison .
so coffee shop ?
the nerve . talking about ya behind your back and right to your face .
no . no suze .
who are you describin ?
named suze ?
hey i thought you went to the game .
wait . way way way way way way wait . who ? .
hey hey hey wait wait wait wait . what happened .
well wait wait wait wait . what do you mean involved ? .
can you believe that ?
what of course without reggie miller it 's a blowout .
on what ? .
yeah all right .
oh . too bad .
believe it or not geooorge is n't at home .
hey mike how bout those knicks ?
why not ?
mike . you say you 're a bookie ? you take a bet ang then you ca n't pay ? i do n't know mike to me it sounds a little how you say phony ?
you know you 're supposed to be the bookie . act like one .
something wrong with this trunk .
well why does n't he just come in ?
why is he scared .
yeah but
it was an accident .
i do n't want it that way .
fine
ah it 's just a car .
i do n't know i just see you guys together .
so peterman bought it ? i ca n't believe you got away with that .
yeah i know how you feel .
what ?
oh the trunk 's broken it 's rattling .
well there 's only one thing to do . eliminate her .
get rid of susie . make her disappear .
she 's gooone .
gone . that bumper sticker .
where did susie find the time to meet all these people
suze ? i actually had a little thing with her for a while . her too .
yeah but he did n't sleep with both of em .
not only that i broke his thumbs .
what are you doing ? all right all right . what 's the matter with that ? what about that one ?
he was good in man from uncle .
i know i 'm having my root canal the same week .
no i do n't want to see the naked people .
i have a vague recollection of doing something with someone but it was a long long time ago .
i remember that it 's a good thing . someday i hope to do it again .
what ?
what look ?
i gave a look ?
what kind of look ?
then what was it ?
well you 're the big look expert . i want to see how smart you are .
what ?
i do n't know .
no . things pop into your head . you ?
yeah me too . well you ca n't expect to just forget the past completely .
i mean it was something we did . probably about what ? twenty five times ?
yeah we pretty much know what we 're doing in there .
no big surprises .
what do you think ?
well it 's something to consider .
i mean let 's say we did .
is that like the end of the world or something ?
why should n't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to ?
i mean really what is the big deal ? we go in there . we 're in there for a while . we come right back out here . it 's not complicated .
it 's moronic .
of course i guess maybe some little problems could arise .
i mean if anything happened and we could n't be friends the way we are now that would be really bad .
because this is very good .
that would be good too . the idea is combine the this and the that . but this cannot be disturbed .
but of course we 'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems . maybe some rules or something .
for example now i call you whenever i 'm inclined and vice versa .
but if we did that we might feel a certain obligation to call .
beautiful . let 's make it a rule .
now here 's another little rule .
when we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters . but sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over . when that is not really sleep . sleep is separate from that . and i do n't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that .
well now we 're getting somewhere .
tough one . you 're call .
fine . well .
you ready ?
so think you can handle this ?
hey .
not yet .
i have n't been out yet .
no i think i saw him on land a couple times . so how 's the job situation goin ?
nothing much . i slept with elaine last night .
i thought you 'd like that .
i know .
no i ca n't do details .
i ca n't give details .
i 'm not in the mood .
all right okay . we 're in the apartment watching tv .
on the couch .
no separated .
around eleven .
so she 's flipping around the tv and she gets to the naked station .
and then somehow we started talking about what if we had sex .
it pains me to say this but i may be getting to mature for details .
well . i 'll tell you though . it was really passionate .
she must 've taken some kind of seminar or something .
not exactly .
well we 've tried to arrange a situation where we 'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends .
i think we 've worked out a system .
no this is very advanced . we 've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls .
okay . no calls the next day .
you ready for the second one ?
spending the night . optional .
no that 's the rule . it 's optional .
i think you 're wrong .
is this yours or the roommate 's ?
would she mind ?
well that 's too bad cause i 'm taking it .
well guess i 'll get going .
well i got that root canal tomorrow morning . it 'll be easier if i go home .
i do n't understand . is there a problem ? i 'm getting the impression there 's a problem .
i 'm having surgery tomorrow .
but you said it can be very serious .
what happened to the rules ? remember ? sleeping over was optional .
it has nothing to do with whose house it is .
hi .
hi .
i ca n't go if you 're mad .
you seemed a little mad .
so you 're okay with everything ?
definitely . well goodnight .
what ?
no no . i have to be very careful here . i do n't want to send the wrong message . especially after the other night .
no no . you ca n't get her anything better than me . whatever i spend you have to spend half .
you do n't understand . i 'm in a very delicate position . whatever i give her she 's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it .
i think i heard her say something about a bench .
i do n't know but she mentioned a bench .
i do n't know .
i have no idea .
forget the bench .
no too relationshippy . she opens it up she hears that laura 's theme i 'm dead .
nice looking fellow .
too romantic .
too sexual .
too domestic .
too gubernatorial .
maybe you wo n't like it .
you could not like it .
of course i remembered . you reminded me everyday for two months . oh the card .
would do you think ?
well this way i figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want . no good ?
well come on . that 's $NUM right there . i do n't think that 's anything to sneeze at .
i said and more . '
what 's wrong with pal ? why is everyone so down on pal ?
great .
well goody for you .
NUM bucks .
could you excuse us please ?
we 're talking .
you know we never had one fight before this deal .
never .
we got along beautifully .
it was wonderful .
so i think we should just forget the whole deal and go back to being friends .
you what ?
you mean it 's no this . no that . no this or that . oh boy . hmmm . what do you want ?
oh sure . of course you 're entitled . who does n't want this that and the other ?
well
i never should have made up those rules .
it ca n't be the nudity . i never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when i was changing before gym class .
why ?
what did you end up giving her ?
sorry about that .
well if i call her there 's no joking around anymore . this is pretty much it .
could be it .
she 's at it as you get . imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband . and she tells me he 's a sculptor they live in vermont
we 'd get caught i 'd get the chair .
plus you know what else .
hey .
yeah .
and the other .
morning .
ah baking soda . annoying little product . i can do this . i can do that . why does n't this stuff just shut up ?
ooh ooh
so ? she used the toothbrush .
yeah .
how many years of med school did you have ?
jenna 's like me . she 's very
i 'll take fastidious .
what is that ?
they do n't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say holy cow' do they ?
why did n't you pull over ?
bring it on . nothing 's throwing me at this point .
oh that adopt a highway thing .
aw looks just like you .
so what do you have to do ? pay to keep it clean ?
that old scam .
at the side of the road with a pile of garbage .
you lost phil rizzuto 's head ? .
no .
well they 're not here . you 'll have to dig up your spare set .
so ?
well i cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf .
by the time i 'm through with her mouth she 'll be able to eat off it . is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it ?
you did n't look down ?
poor son of a bitch .
it 's a hundred thousand revolutions a second . it 's the most powerful one they make .
the engine 's made by mcdonnell douglas .
oh no you keep going . it shuts off automatically .
when the battery runs out .
no trust me that one was doing more harm than good . do n't forget to use the plax too .
i do n't know anything about that .
that 's the idea .
you know maybe we better not . i i think i 'm getting a little cold . i do n't want to give you any of my germs .
she has a taint . i ca n't see it but i know it 's there .
maybe if i could shrink myself down like in fantastic voyage and get inside a microscopic submarine i could be sure . although if there was something there it might be pretty scary . course i would have that laser .
being really clean and happy ?
disorder ?
hmm that could hurt me . hey there it is .
nah we 've seen it .
what 's with the signs ?
yeah that stuff 's all natural anyway .
hey . so keys ?
i guess they leave that up to the general population .
hard to say .
yeah ?
if you guys would n't mind i would like to ward off dementia .
hi .
good . my coldo s gone and i 've been looking forwards to kissing you which i 'm ready to do now if you are ready .
nothing . i just i uh i bruised my lip . i was drinking a celray and i brought it up too fast and i banged it into my lip and then i knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and i was n't able to tell you before you could use it .
i 'm sorry .
obviously never .
kramer i 'm kind of in the middle of something . would you get these signs out of here please ?
i would n't know where to start .
hey jenna . hey .
what ? . wha what 'd you put in there ?
oh man .
hello jenna did you dunk the spatula ? was it the spatula ? hello ? dammit .
no . could be anything . the whole apartment 's a biohazard .
yes that is a definite possibility .
are you just screwing with me ?
hey how 's life on the road ?
i do n't doubt it .
what 's this ?
is n't that some kind of safety thing ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
yeah in my toolshed next to the riding mower .
one q ? whose apartment is that ?
you 're pretending to live in a janitor 's closet just to get this flounder ?
is the flounder here yet ?
nice . french doors 'd really open this place up . oh but you have a slop bucket .
hey .
kramer 's guys ?
oh that 's nice kind of a hard labour fantasy camp .
i do n't feel like eating .
well i thought it 's about time we put aside all this silliness . i know now you did n't put anything in my toilet bowl . did you ?
well whatever . so how 've you been ?
good . steak knife ?
nah .

toilet brush oh . alright i can replace that .
yeah . let 's uh go to your place . because i threw out all my dishes .
that 's true .
but i 'll tell you this much . i am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of what could be a meaningful long lasting relationship .
i do n't know what that could be .
anyway i 'm a new man and i 'm looking towards the future . clean dirty whatever .
holy cow . have a nice life .
you know at the movies they show that little ad for the concession stand ?
he 's wailing on that banjo .
i just do n't understand the raisinettes .
yeah .
the box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand buys another box of raisinettes .

why do n't you just have him paged ?
a bomb threat ? why would i call in a bomb threat ?
i should have some reason .
yeah .
over here . you can see right through here .
it 's kind of cozy .
does it smell like the east river ?
because kramer has been swimming laps between the queensborough bridge and the brooklyn bridge .
i do n't think it 's that bad .
no the stools go over there .
you mean they 're actually doing the fitted hats ? cool .
hey look at you .
no knock offs . i want the ones like the real players wear .
could you at least get a hat for me ?
seven and five eighths
why are you shouting ?
yes this is the terrorist bomber .
think i 've changed my mind .
what ?
i guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out .
yeah that 's right .
one second . hello .
just lie down .
all right . i 'll be right there . conrad i got to go .
ah back to normal . not bad for four thousand bucks . . . . i ca n't believe i got the low fat .
i saw it .

i noticed she 's big on the phrase yada yada . '
no yada yada is good . she 's very succinct .
yeah it 's like you 're dating usa today .
hey george you know tim whatley .
what 's up ?
excuse me ?
well welcome aboard .
elaine the guy 's jewish two days he 's already making jewish jokes .
booze is not a religion .
ooh . beth lookner still waiting out hat marriage .
i got to get on that internet . i 'm late on everything .

all right that 's enough . now get going . get outta here .
george
hey .
tim do you think you should be making jokes like that ?
i know but
NUM .
and then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride .
i 'll tell you why . because i believe whatley converted to judaism just for the jokes .
yes .
all right take it easy .
how you doing ?
whatley .
so whatley sayd to me hey i can make catholic jokes i used to be catholic . '
do n't you see what whatley is after ? total joke telling immunity . he 's already got the two big religions covered if he ever gets polish citizenship there 'll be no stopping him .
i think this father curtis might be very interested to hear what whatley has the pope doing with raquel welch .
they 're not getting a baby so you 're taking them out to lunch ?
poor beth .
oh screw him .
but you yada yada 'd over the best part .
george is already in there .
i thought you were leaning towards julie .
excuse me mother ?
sister right . do you know when father curtis has office hours ?
hmm i really need to speak with him .
oh .
well i should tell you that i 'm jewish .
oh good . anyway i wanted to talk to you about dr . whatley . i have a suspicion that he 's converted to judaism just for the jokes .
no it offends me as a comedian . and it 'll interest you that he 's also telling catholic jokes .
and they 're old jokes . i mean the pope and raquel welch in a lifeboat .
oh i 'm sure you have . they 're out on the ocean and yada yada yada and she says those are n't buoys . father
you know the difference between a dentist and a sadist do n't you ?
newer magazines .

kramer he 's just a dentist .
i am not an anti dentite .
they do have their own schools .

i like the way you think .
oh my god . number one . seinfeld you magnificent bastard .
some of us .
hola .
what is all this ?
ah no wonder we 're getting so much rain .
hi valerie .
you 're not valerie .
but i never
you know uh valerie i uh could n't help but notice that i 'm on your speed dial .
but i ca n't help thinking that maybe there 's someone in your life who deserves it more . someone you 've known you know more than a week .
what ? no .
yikes .
how could they not fire you ?
aw come on there now .
nonsense . you do everything wrong .
everything .
absolutely . i have no confidence in you .
that 's the spirit . you suck .
well mrs hamilton it 's certainly nice that you and valerie patched things up so we could all get together like this . where is valerie ?
okay .
uh good .
what ?
i do n't know mrs hamilton . that does n't sound
valerie 's not coming over is she ?
no
stop stop . this is n't right . what about valerie ?
wuhh
oh my god george .
kramer look it 's george .
fine .
no problem .
what 're you doing with a pricing gun ?
still a rip off .
hello ?
uh well she uh probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you .
hold on a second .
hello ?
oh mrs hamilton this is a very bad time . i 've got valerie on the other line . just a second .
hello ?
well
hang on .
she knows about the speed dial . mrs hamilton you got to get me off this thing .

great bye .
she said she 'll do it .
hang on .
hello ?
she never sees the big picture .
hello newman .
no .
by the way newman i 'm just curious . when you booked the hotel did you book it for the millennium new year ?
oh that 's interesting because as everyone knows since there was no year zero the millennium does n't begin until the year two thousand and one . which would make your party one year late and thus quite lame .
aww .
hello ?
it 's jerry . who 's this ?
oh hi valerie . what 's up ?
wow poison control ? that 's even higher than number one .
hello ?
hang on just let me pick up a paper .
let 's go .
for how long ?
come on .
i 'm going to be this guy 's friend .
new clothes ?
strange . for new pants there 's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos . wait those are the clothes from the bag .
he asked you to watch them not wear them .
you look like a tourist .
when you hear like a soft russeling .
oh right the new job how is it ?
so who 's the new you ?
oh hi alex .
no .
right here george . in here . try opening this up . you 'll find the biggest dating scene in the world .
get out . get out . i do n't want to live like this .
hmm . that looks new .
yeah that 's too bad .
nothing .
i did something stupid .
well i was shaving . and i noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and i was trying to even it out . next thing i knew gone .
well women do it .
well what am i going to tell alex ?
um hum .
hey .
you could n't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend . i mean it 's hard enough
really ?
so you 're pretending to be a tourist ?
how do you explain your apartment ?
you moved into a hotel ?
so get this we 're in the park today alex goes wild for this hairless dog .
so . i figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another .
are you nuts ? i do n't want her to think i 'm one of those low rise briefs guys who shaves his chest .
the last thing this guy 's qualified to give a tour of is reality .
you 're moving to new york ? that 's fantastic . i can see you all the time now .
what is it she think you ca n't do ?
how did you do those things ?
hey what were you doing with that bus yesterday ?
the real peterman reality bus tour . i 'm confused .
nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person 's life .
yeah . $NUM . NUM for a three musketeers .
what ? ca n't i get a moment 's peace ?
i ca n't stop . alex thinks i 'm naturally hairless .
oh that 's an old wives tale .
oh come on . that 's genetics . that 's not going to happen to me .
why do i have to go on the tour ?
hey how 's business ?
you also should n't use a donut .
can we just go ?
you know i never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him but this is pretty close .
what 's that ?
oh . yeah .
kramer how much longer ? my chest hair is comming back and it 's itching me like crazy . i ca n't let her see me scratch it .
i 'm telling you man i 'm losing it .
i ca n't sit on this bus anymore . i think i 'll go play with that dog .
awoooooo oooooooo that feels good .
nah you had a good run . took them to the world series .
do n't sell yourself short . you made all the flight arrangements hotels busses .
so when you actually did work what it was that you did ?
maybe i should ask her out ?
that 's true . maybe i take her to the tony 's .
yeah i wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets .
they 're musicians . that 's not a joke .
they did it for three years . what 's another few months .
like what ?
i 've always wanted to do that
you mean golf ?
like this ?
that 's so strange .
oh what about ladies night ? women admitted free before NUM ?
reer .
boy your really packing it all in .
like what ?
stomach ache ?
aah top of the fridge . hey george i 'm taking that waitress to the tony 's .
where are you sitting ?

absolutely .
ok
thanks lyle
so you and lyle are roommates ?
gay ?
is he gay ?
are you sure ?
this is a new one .
yeah when i went to pick her up there was this dude .
what do you think it couldo ve been just some dude ?
i reckon .
dude .
it 's NUM NUM in the morning ?
so has the summer of george already started or are you still de composing ?
you did n't give that thing back ?
that 's because you did n't win .
you have n't even seen it .
hi .
no rush .
i have absolutely no idea .
except that the dude plays the showroom and i 'm stuck doing food and beveridged .
it 's kramer .
george says hi .
why do n't you just come over ?
he 's looking on to fridgerator .
i ca n't do this .
he 's not doing anything . goodbye .
are you taking the tony to sardi 's ?
oh hello .
all right all right .
i said no .
just me ? no dudes or fellas ?
i can start right away .

ok ok
no i 'll crab it .
what did you lose your remote ?
it 's lanette . i need an assistant or intern or something .
not .
no because that 's
here .
i 'm trying .
then each of us would only have be like a half man . that sounds about right .
why they want you to fire raquel welch ?
she seems very nice .
i 'm in show business .
i 've got a tape of fantastic voyage if you think that would help .
did you tell peterman about this ?
because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there 's a chance they might somehow kiss .
you got the tickets ?
i like it .
what ?
hey george one second she 's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations .
NUM and george on the invitations

i told you we should have taken some kind of vacation .
because you said this would be better . remember ? a vacation from ourselves . that 's what you said .
no .
stop it george . stop it . i 'm sorry you 've got to get a job .
no more crutches that must be a relief .
not with a cane ?
that is a sad story . hey you should have been here tonight . some guy from nbc saw my set he wants me to do a showcase . i might have another shot at a pilot .
we ? no .
killed ?
yeah killed . because i killed first and warmed up the crowd . he 's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark .

well that 's it . you two are back together .
the bump into . the bump into always leads to the backslide .
elaine breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine . you ca n't do it in one push you got to rock it back and forth a few times and then it goes over .
that 's different . i did n't have feelings for those people . but you you 'll backslide

there 's no hazing of the fetus or anything is there ?
when is this suppose to be ?
saturday ? well i have a show in buffalo on saturday . they 're not going to bust up my apartment or anything are they ?

leave me alone .
i 'm not getting illegal cable .

what 's with this airline ? what are you cutting out the drinks now ?
are they going to go over the instructions again ?
i 'm not afraid of flying although many people do have fear of flying and i have no arguement with that . i think fear of flying is quite rational because human beings cannot fly . humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving . put a fish behind the wheel and they go this is n't right . i should n't be doing this . i do n't belong here . '
oh fire engines ambulances all along the runway . and then when we landed safely they all seemed so disappointed .
well there was so much snow . the roads were closed . i really appreciate it you picking me up . thanks again .

you 'll never say that to her face .
the show was cancelled . there was a blizzard .
well leslie sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason .
i 'm sorry i

i 'm not paying four hundred dollars . i do n't even want the thing . what are you going to do ? .
alright i said i had a good time and i 'd call but who takes that literally ?
what do you do at the end of a date when you know you do n't want to see this person ever again for the rest of your life ? what do you say ? what do you say ? no matter what you say it 's a lie . i 'll see you around . see you around . if you 're around and i 'm around i 'll see you around that area . you 'll be around other people . you wo n't be around me . but you will be around . take care now . did you ever say that to somebody ? take care now . take care now . because i 'm not going to be taking care of you . so you should take care now . take care . take care . what does this mean ? take off . is n't that what you really want to say ? take off now .

hey you guys think i 'm getting a little chunky ?
elaine what do you think ?
did n't go for it huh ?
so she did n't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats ?
natural ? sex is about love between a man and a woman not a man and a sandwich .
maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs how about satisfying one of somebody else 's .

she 's even got that old mattel football game that we love .
oh like he 's not just carrying you . and has been for years .
so when i saw george on the street with an NUM pound turkey and a giant box of wine i thought what a coincidence . we 're just about to eat .
i think . have some more wine .
oh george brought home movies of his boyhood trip to michigan .
more heavy gravy ?
maybe it 'll be fun having a pet .
what about my questionable material ?
jim fowler ? the animal guy from wild kingdom is coming to your apartment ?
tic tacs work ?
what ? it 's a victimless crime .
okay one victim .
you know that batter is like NUM years old .
you 're like eight years old .
it was great . i 've done it a few more time since then .
no not a thing .
what what is this ? what is she doing here ?
well what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine ?
so the whole set was destroyed ?
so the squirrel 's going to make it ?
on the couch ? so you 're
morning .
but why ?
you do n't think she 's just talking to me ?
you shut up .
we 'll come to work with you .
and shopping .
the boom box incident ?
seems reasonable .
even more reasonable .
and that guy is your new boss ?
right they could n't get the green stuff off .
neither have i .
where did you get this thing ?
hey i got a date with that doctor you met .
mmhu .
what 's with you ?
your whole building smells like potatoes .
i think we might have one left in the stock room .
well i have this neighbor
is it anything like hitting a home run in softball ?
cause i hit a whopper last week .
he took out kruger ?
where did you get that butcher 's coat ?
eh died on the table . just spent hour and a half making me feel if i do n't save lives i 'm worthless .
dermatology ?
saving lives ? the whole profession is eh just put some aloe on it .
oh what 's the point ?

till she found out elaine slept with the groom .
i ca n't believe we went all the way to india for a wedding .
george i 'm sorry .
i do n't know what that means .
that 's got to hurt i do n't care where you 're from .
hey .
oh you were pretty loaded .
oh . hello tetanus .
george we need to talk .
alright i admit it . i slept with nina but that 's all .
i 'm really sorry .
where 'd you get that one ?
that does n't punish me . it punishes elaine . and cruelly i might add .
how did he find out ?
you know you 're not supposed to drink while you 're keeping a secret . is there anything else ?
here drink this .
pinter ?
so ? who cares about that ?
oh nobody 's calling off any weddings . alright it 's time to go . come on up .
no what ?
yes jugdish .
yes i think it 's a fine idea . well good night .

this is going to be great .
elaine have you noticed george was acting strange the whole flight ?
uh huh . hey look what they had on the plane . schnapps .
coach to india the only way to go .
you all right ?
hey did n't i beat you up in the fourth grade ?
you just asked me two minutes ago .
ah i 'm not wearing a watch .
yeah . how 'd ya do that ?
i 'm just hanging out in this hell hole because of george .
oh come on . you know he 's a postman do n't ya ?
what are you talking about .
by flying half way around the world ?
especially when you got a layover in sarajevo .
hey hey kramer what are you doing ? you want to borrow something ? you want to eat something ? come on in .
h hey kramer wait up . i 'll go with you .
great i love newman .
uh huh .
mm hmm . mm hmm
uh huh
sure .
uh huh .
uh huh .
uh well you know a coffee grinder is nice . or a coffee maker . everyone likes coffee . anything to do with coffee . maybe you should go get some coffee .
sure .
look there was an awkward moment in the conversation . it never happened before .
nothing . and neither will you . george can never know about this it 'll crush him .
no good . too many people know the combination .
oh my god . this drawer is filled with fruit loops .
and milk .
hello ?
ah just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him .
believe me . you know i forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you .
i know . no awkward pauses . probably the reason we never fooled around
probably the reason
kramer i know what i 'm talking about . there 's no way fdr wants you to drop dead .
just go back and ask him again .
crook eye ?
well everybody 's a little cranky on their birthday .
everyday is my birthday .
well at least the wedding gown will give her some support .
so you think it 's a non vite ?
ah it 's probably like smith over there .
he wants me to set him up with this girl nina stengal .
i was kidding when i said that .
nina hi . it 's jerry .
hey how bout my friend george ? quite a guy huh ?
get outta here .
hmm
sure .
are you ?
we were too compatible our conversations were so engrossing .
if we ever had a problem with elaine we could bring in nina and not lose a step .
anyway like i was saying i could n't make the transition from conversation to sex . there were no awkward pauses i need an awkward pause .
why ?
so you 're going to wear em no matter what the situation ?
oh i 'm sure it 's fine .
almost . hey new timberlands ?
really ?
nina ?
it 's been years .
george this is nina .
what are you a scientist ? .
ah .
great talking to you . what the hell is e mail ?
pretty good . i think she might be the one .
what are you bringing snowballs in here for ?
hi elaine .
oh hi . i i 'm jerry seinfeld . i 'm moving in . i saw your name on the buzzer you must be kessler .
oh .
no thanks . but i ordered a pizza . you want some of it ?
why not ? we 're neighbors . what 's mine is yours .
any second now . light is on . melissa waffles are ready .
how about that .
she did n't even want a napkin .
oh it 's a scene .
i do n't really have enough room .
hey .
back together ?
ah
why now ?
still with the neck hole ?
a cashmere sweater .
no i think the head does most of the stretching .
that was an hour ago . what were you doing in there ?
ten minutes .
so ?
i think the damage is probably already done . all right . i 'll get that . well maybe she just practices good hygiene .
mmm .
zephyr ? that is not a word .
no i do not challenge .
i 'd accuse you of cheating but i do n't know where you 'd hide the tiles .
sure .
coughing naked it 's a turn off man .
when you cough there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action . it 's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion .
but the thing you do n't realize is that there 's good naked and bad naked . naked hair brushing good naked crouching bad . hey there 's hanke .
thank you . i did notice and i appreciate you rectifying it .
you got some suds over here .
oh come on .
you promise you 'll never come in here again ?
now my sense of it is that you 're probably wasting time working piecemeal first cleaning one area then another .
but when you have a faucet instead of a tongue you want to use gravity .
no i told you it 's just a dry run .
that 's step ten ?
you 're not getting any skin kramer .
what happened to you ?
here ya go .
what ?
oh .
oh . that was n't really necessary . i do n't ride it . it 's just for show .
please do n't crouch .
oh that 's bad . especially that area .
uhh
look please stop . let me help you with that .
i ca n't . i ca n't look anymore . i i i 've seen too much .
well technically he did apologize .
so now you want an apology for the apology plus the original apology ?
well i hit the wall yesterday with lady godiva . she did a full body flex on a pickle jar .
where am i going to get a fat guy and a cannonball ?
yeah .
hello ?
world war i plane ?
when are ya getting out ?
i found a rough spot on the kitchen floor i thought i 'd polish it up with this belt sander i have here .
i thought naked is good .
he took you to rage aholics ? why ?
you 've got a little rage .
by the way my bad naked demo did n't quite work .
oh great . elaine . what is wrong with my body ?
that 's it ?
well i was walking around naked in front of melissa the other day
so you do n't think it 's attractive ?
so i 'm glad we had a talk and worked this out . do n't you feel this is better ?
yes clothes . this is normal .
oh yeah . what ? i 'm sorry .
oh maybe a haircut and i do n't know maybe a
we could n't carry on a conversation . i kept trying to picture her naked she kept trying to not picture me naked .
so what are you up to ?
insert a knife into the center and twist . then to make it bloom soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes .
oh sure . with out the parents it 's a breeze .
hey tim . great party .
you have a standard fake ?
that 's neat .
hi i 'm jerry .
hey . how 'd it go with the cocktail franks ?
did n't you call in sick yesterday ?
you 're going to open your mail here ?
see ? you give and you get .
oh that 's nice .
to a children 's charity .
hey .
atomic sub ? why are you eating there ?
what does that mean ?
when george was growing up
his father
hated all the commercial and religious aspects of christmas so he made up his own holiday .
and instead of a tree did n't your father put up an aluminum pole ?
and were n't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying ?
so ?
no you walk out .
no you wait for the movie .
you do n't need the card . high end hoagie outfit like that it 's all computerized . they 're cloning sheep now .
so why do n't you just try your blow off number and see if he 's called it ?
what strike ?
you ?
bagels ?
why did n't you ever mention this ?
hey tim .
actually i 'm having dinner with a girl i met at your party .
gwen ?
really ?
have you come across this ?
like the batman villain ?
so if i ask her out again i do n't know who 's showing up the good the bad or the ugly .
yeah .
a donation has been made in your name to the human fund . what is that ?
the human fund . money for people . '
it has a certain understated stupidity .
yeah .
how was your first day ?
your hands were in the dough ?
happy festivus .
when george was growing up
his father
you 're still trying to gget that free sub ?
is there a captain 's hat involved in this ?
boy am i glad to see you .
you never know .
so uh what do you feel like eating ? chinese or italian ?
you 're telling me .
actually the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there .
i ca n't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop . i mean what if things you know progress ?
alright i 'll give it a shot . i do really like this coffee shop . nice cuff links by the way .
that 's not a french cuff shirt you know .
oh that 's classy .
i there . this is kramer and frank .
uh why do n't we stay here ? the back booth just opened up . now this is a good looking booth .
why ? it 's our place .
oh i know who 's cooking today .
hey georgie .
i 'll be here .
she did n't touch it .
NUM thousand dollars from kruger ? you 're not keeping this .
excuse me ?
you want to give something back ? start with the NUM thousand dollars .
you 're going to start your own charity ?
they nailed you on the NUM g 's ?
gwen . how 'd you know i was here ?
gwen . gwen wait . ah . bad lighting on the porch .
i thought you were on strike ?
yeah they have been promising that for a while
i think ed begley jr . has one .
what about harrison ford ? he had one in uh blade runner . that was a cool one .
well what do you think the big holdup is ?
yeah right . and what about the floating cities ?
it 's like we 're living in the NUMs here .
would you stop it ? you 'll have plenty of time to destroy it after i get it . hey george i 'm buying this car .
you 're getting that vein again .
it 'll be twenty minutes . i told ya puddy 's getting me an insider deal .
i guess he graduated .
thank you .
all right . calm down .
all right we 're going in .
george . sorry we 're just waiting for david puddy .
hey .
ah . where 'd you go ?
so puddy i decided i 'm going to go with another NUM convertible .
au revoir le george .
so puddy this is a pretty good move for you huh ? no more grease monkey .
oh . sorry i did n't know
i saw one once that could do sign language .
yeah koko .
no . we both just saw the same monkey .
where 's your money ?
hey elaine have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit ?
no .
no . he keeps asking me to give him a high five .
slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual . in fact even some of them have moved on they 're doing sign language now .
what do you think the nazis were doin ? that was the heil five .
it was a good bit in the NUM 's and it 's still relatable today .
i think the candy comes out over there .
either that or they 've got a weird little hang up about lying face down in filth . why do n't you just go to the cashier ?
how much was under there ?
hey puddy thinks i should go for the cd player . what do you think ?
hey can i have my dollar back ?
hey . wh where are you ?
did you two break up ?
rust proofing ?
finder 's fee ? it was on the lot .
keys ? .
hey george .
no last one . listen you got to help me out . elaine and puddy just broke up he 's treating me just like a regular customer now .
so listen puddy . when we first started this deal i thought things were going to be different . now if you want to play hard ball i got my friend george here and he can play pretty hard ball . george vein it up .
george . can we focus on the car here ?
yellow ? i wanted black .
george would you help me please ?
sing it sister .
oh god
i 'll be right back .
hey george .
elaine you 've got to get back down to the dealer . puddy is screwing me on this car which is yellow now .
elaine .
you got to get back together with puddy so i can make this deal .
you 're going to get back together anyway . it 's thousands of dollars .
come on . then you do n't have to see him again til my NUM NUM mile check .
fine .
no . no lunch .
all right . lunch .
bye .
everybody 's ripping me off .
no no . no elaine the car can wait . what 's important is you two getting back together . eh then we 'll talk about the car .
okay . now i know this is an important decision . why do n't we all just sit down and talk about it ? come on come on . now look you both find each other attractive right ?
clearly no one else can stand to be with either one of you .
all right . now what do i have to do to put you two in a relationship today ?
all right . elaine david i believe we have a deal here in principle arby 's no more than once a month . and in exchange elaine comes to your softball game and does n't read a book .
so you 're back together ?
all right all right . all right that 's enough . let 's get back to my deal . that undercoating that 's a rip off is n't it david ?
so i 'm getting the insider 's deal ?
and where does it end ? then everyone 's doing it . it 's like the wave at ball games . air quotes . the phrase do n't go there . someone 's got to take a stand .
and who were you trying to set up anyway ? the mechanic or the manager ?
i think there 's a mental hospital near here .
so puddy wear 's a man fur ?
and of course you find fur morally reprehensible .
you might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer .
kramer said it 's a perfect gift . that 's what we 're getting him .
cheapness is not a sense .
i had a great time at the last one . i was in charge of the music . i turned that mother out .
hey .
what has newman got another army man stuck in his ear ?
but then anyone can just look in and see you .
hey george . here 's the model number on that chair by the way .
what ?
that 's a five .
except the store 's in delaware .
maybe cheapness is a sense . you know it is better without this big wallet . it 's more comfortable .
why ?
but look at this thing . it 's it 's huge . you got more cow here than here .
irish money ?
show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster .
george i am loving this no wallet thing .
you know the very fact that you oppose this makes me think i 'm onto something .
hey joe mayo . nice place .
music ?
but i could do that and the music .
i was ready to get jiggy with it .
hey elaine .
so elaine notice anything different about my pants ?
so we 're giving him nothing ?
did you at least get him a card ?
hi i 'm jerry . how do you like my pants ?
it 's working . do n't tap on the glass .
because you threw it out .
but you did actually throw his coat out the window .
but that 's you .
of course . because of that wallet . you you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass .
what was that ?
all set . i ca n't believe i 'm going dancing .
no because it 's so stupid . shall we ?
compact lipstick all this ?
what are you a medieval dungeon master ?
ow . sharp key .
you do n't understand . i went on a successful pocket diet and i want to keep that weight off .
not more of that crap from the titanic ?
i 'm not carrying a purse .
oh .
i do n't know .
hey george did you get joe mayo that chair yet ?
what ?
no .
well so what ? you 're getting a deal right ? we 'll split it three ways .
what is that noise ?
you know sometimes i get the feeling george is n't being completely honest with me .
what was that pop sound ?
it 's european .
uh yeah i think i do . i can never find anything in here . ah here it is . so that joe mayo throws the worst parties does n't he ? so what was your job ?
what he does n't like my taste in music ?
you shouldo ve been there last year . i got jiggy with it .
i have to do what ?
i 'm not wearing the fur .
is that right ?
newman too ?
that 's my walkman .
all right .
george did you get that chair yet ?
you know what ? just call up and cancel it . i 'm out .
joe mayo does n't like my taste in music . he 's not getting a gift from me .
no you do n't have to buy anything .
i do n't understand . why did n't you tell us you had it ?
because of your giant wallet . just get rid of it .
your good friend is morbidly obese .
it 's not a purse . it 's european .
all right .
how do i look ?
hey silvio just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat .
it sure is .
that 's true .
oh thanks .
maybe this is n't my coat .
no it 's not . it 's mine . i 'm a fancy boy .
hey . officer . someone took my european carryall .
the black leather thing with a strap .
yes a purse . i carry a purse .
so silvio ambushed joe mayo ?
he should have had a reverse peephole .
hello ? hello ?
so your saying unicef is a scam ?
oh . no it 's sally weaver .
no it 's susan ross 's old college roommate she moved to new york a few years ago . she 's trying to become an actress .
untalented she 's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation . it 's really depressing .
she should just give up .
heeyyy .
kramer .
so susan 's dead
why 'd you have to say anything to her ?
why ca n't you ever keep your big mouth shut ?
what did you want to be ?
i do n't either .
it looks like my accountant 's office but there 's no pets working there .
you 've been hiding her from us . you must really like her ?
she does not .
hey . kramer .
what . you 're the one who ruined her life .
well i got to talk her out of this .
she does stink and she should quit . but i do n't want it to be because of me . it should be the traditional route years of rejections and failures till she 's spit out the bottom of the porn industry .
yeah
george 's girlfriend elaine thinks she looks like me but i think it 's as you would say kookie talk .
what are you doing ? do n't tell a woman she looks like a man and george does n't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do i
you do n't broach you keep your mouth shut .
yeah . because of you .
sally you ca n't quit the business . this is all because of me .
you ca n't give up . you do n't think people tell me i stink ? when i 'm on stage that 's all i hear you stink you suck . we like magic .
of course i stink you stink . it 's show bizz . everybody stinks
all right i think we 've covered my act . now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else .
now .
oh . i think we 're at the bottom .
yeah . what does that mean ?
elaine huh ? she 's completely
no
it 's ludicrous
for either one of us
so
i 'm not gay .
come on in here .
what 's happening ? what you doing come and talk to us .
lets talk about that .
yeah right .
kramer you 're never going to be able to completely stop talking .
well what does this mean ?
kramer there 's no way you stick to this .
oh . you just starting now ?
sally i ca n't believe you 're already doing a one woman show ?
ah . there you are .
aw right code of silence how 's that going ? ha .

hunger will make people do amazing things . i mean the proof of that is cannibalism . cannibalism what do they say i mean they 're eating and you know this is good who is this ? i like this persong . you know i mean i would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep you know what i mean ? i would think you 'd be like who is that ? who 's there ? who 's there ? is somebody there ? what do you want ? what do you want ? you look hungry are you hungry ? get out of here . '
she said no ?

george both parties do n't have to consent to a break up . it 's not like you 're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys . obviously you did n't make a convincing case . let me hear your arguments .
that 's good .
solid .
always popular .
you have an airtight case .
i 'm afraid we 're out of time .
hey .

it 's liable to bounce and go into a sewer .
you 'll chicken out at the last second .
all right . hey you know what 's weird ?
i used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep . but i ca n't anymore .

well let 's think . have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation ?
good . how did you handle that ?
same situation . pay him off and you 're clean .
hey where have you been ?
we found out his super power was lack of money .
he 's invulnerable to creditors .
he 's the got no green lantern .
sure just tell maura you 're having an affair .
could you move over there ? .
really ? how come you never pursued her before ?
he can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce .
there 's a giant parrot in the hallway .
who ?
what 'd ya tell him that for ?
really ? what 's it like ? is it nicer than mine ? where does he have the couch ?
he let you ?
hi . is phil here ?
phil hi . i i know we got off to kind of a bad start . but your bird which is lovely by the way made a mess on my door .
i thought maybe you 'd clean it up or your maid there .
all right i think we 're done here .
so you 're in a relationship with a woman you do n't like and you 're having an affair with a woman that wo n't have sex with you .
i cannot find my jerry lewis cufflinks . without em i have no in .
where are you goin ? help me look .

i 'll dig .
well that was easy .
hey kramer . i dug fredo up now let 's cut him open .
hey neighbor .
ah i 'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building .
you mean it was open ? we desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing ?
it 's a wizard electronic organizer for my dad . i 'm going to florida for his birthday .
two hundred . but i 'll tell him it 's fifty . he does n't care about the gift . he gets excited about the deal .
ah i 'll tell him i got it on the street and maybe it 's hot . that 's his favorite .
susan 's parents ? when 's the last time you talked to them ?
why because you picked out the poision envelopes ? that 's silly .
still no puddy ?
what ? about you dating a black guy ? what 's the big deal ?
darryl . he 's black is n't he ?
is n't he elaine ?
what 's his last name ?
i think he 's black .
why not ?
if he 's black .
does it matter ?
oh so you need to know ?
uh one second .
house in the hamptons ?
hey .
wow . what are we celebrating ?
with the little legs ?
how much are they paying you ?
that 's funny because i have n't seen you working for a while . a long while .
from what ?
what 's that ?
it 's NUM NUM in the morning .
well as long as i 'm up . dad i got you a birthday present . here . happy birthday .
what does that mean ?
radar detector ? i 've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour . you 're like the grand marshall of the rose bowl parade . it 's a wizard organizer .
nah i got it from a guy on the street . it was like fifty bucks .
could be .
and you can do everything with it . you can get e mail fax there 's a calculator .
yeah i guess . but the really cool thing is the daily planner .
kramer what are you doing here ?
kramer you ca n't live down here . this is where people come to die .
not you . older people .
if you feed him he 'll never leave .
i ca n't believe this .
dad it 's got lots of other functions .
well your tip is four dollars and thirty six point six six six six cents .
oh right . you ca n't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo .
what press ?
she 's fifty .
so did you figure out darryl 's you know .
you 're a master of race relations .
yeah it 's all my father 's doing .
he wants to install kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes . preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse .
common sense and a guy in a wheelchair .
(overhearing the other two elaine elaine
oh no .
george listen to me . i have a very important job for you . i want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets do n't dry out and leak .
this is far more important . you must exercise the gaskets george .
hey dad . you know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin . dad you look so different .
you know you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner .
kramer these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here sit in the heat pretend it 's not hot and enforce these rules .
wizards .
kramer
kramer i ca n't get that many wizards .
i did n't have a deal . they 're two hundred dollars a pop . what do i do ?
down here ?
aw .
a willard ? saccamano sr . screwed me .
because a real wizardo s two hundred dollars .
no deal . not hot .
dad i 'm sorry .
it does other things .
and then ?
showmanship george . when you hit that high note you say goodnight and walk off .
that 's the way they do it in vegas .
i hear things .
it 's a used car he probably never changed the presets .
plus he probably does n't even know how to program the buttons .
so you prefer dumb and lazy to religious ?
no no the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person 's .
yeah elaine 's going to do the same thing to puddy 's radio that the radio did to her .
oh she 's picking me up in a few minutes .
i dunno . since the last one . oh here she is . you want to meet her ?
hey mickey . check the pepper shaker .
what 's with the fake sneezing ?
do medical schools actually do this ?
i think the phone is ringing .
would you hold it a second ? . thank you will you get out of here with that stuff ?
hello ?
elaine ?
george ?
oh i knew it was you i was joking . i 'm a comedian .
ipecac ? kramer i really think you guys are going too far with this .
did he overdose ?
what did you do the rest of the day ?
and a bit of a tramp if you ask me .
no . so you 're disappointed he 's a spiritual person ?
i hear things . hey so sophie gave me the it 's me on the phone today .
i thought so .
no no . he 's pretending he 's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it .
showmanship george is trying to get out on a high note .
yes . step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row .
one message . hope it 's not from you .
sophie .
yep .
i think that 's a what 's good for the goose is good for the gander .
it 's a goose that 's had the old switcheroo pulled on it . hi sophie it 's me .
she thinks it 's someone named raef .
so what 's going on ?
so uh how are things with jerry ?
right right the tractor story .
i sound funny ?
yeah i better get to a doctor bye . that was close . what drives me to take chances like that ?
she said there 's some tractor story that she has n't told me about .
beep beep beep ? what are you doing ?
no one 's stealing a tractor it 's a five mile an hour getaway . we 're dancing around the obvious it 's got to be disfigurement .
no she looks completely normal .
you think she 's got toes for thumbs ?
i do n't know .
why do i seek your counsel ?
that seems about right .
hey have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and
what do you care ? you do n't believe in hell .
so it 's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul .
maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity .
they should update these pieces nobody rides horses anymore . maybe they should change it to a tractor .
losing ? you know yesterday i lost control of my car almost bought the farm .
tractor .
wait do n't go . let 's thumb wrestle .
a big long scar where her leg would dangle when she 's riding a ?
i 'm sure she 's a little self conscious and does n't like to talk about it .
she does n't have toe thumbs .
alright . so how 's the two man operation at kruger ?
never .
sophie it 's me . i know about the tractor story and i 'm fine with it .
shh . shh . shh . it 's not important . what 's important is i 'm not going to let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long term and meaningful relationship .
hey hey . i 'm with someone .
you got gonorrhea from a tractor ? and you call that your tractor story ?
alright that 's it for me . you 've been great . goodnight everybody .
first it was the health club then the supermarket now the bookstore . they could put it anywhere they want no one 's meeting anybody .

imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you 'd yelled that out at the actual disaster .
what is that music ?
oh no .
it 's the puerto rican day parade .

i do n't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking . it makes me anxious .
but that 's a one way street coming this way . besides how am i going to get all the way over there ?

one more lane to go .
maroon golf .

you ca n't do that . you ca n't just leave the group .

not you . the guy in the amigo .
elaine why did you have the cab come down the street ? . we were almost out .
elaine he does n't need
cause that 's what 's going to happen .
i do n't know .
hold it george . do n't move . it 's right between your eyes .
hey there 's the soda guy .
all right .
ho ho .
what seems to be the problem officer ?
at me ?
oh . it 's back .
what if it gets in the side ?
yeah . would n't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror faster and faster getting more and more intense until finally
oh . it 's in your eye now .
kramer the mets have got men on base .
you were watchin ? where ?
oh that was a strike . did you see that ? .
eh varnsen . kel varnsen . actually this room intrigues me . why is it called the tv room ?

i love a parade .
well what about my car ?
hey there 's elaine .
well you look uh relaxed .
well at least he did n't
somebody remember where we parked .
take some of mine .
who said you have to like it ?
i do n't like pesto .
look at that guy . i 'll bet you he 's getting hair transplants . any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap ten to one plugs .
oh one more thing about the car . let it warm up for a minute .
i do n't understand why he could n't take a cab .
elaine is having a houseguest . she 's picking him up at the airport tonight .
he 's from a yakima right ?
everybody 's moving to seattle .
well from what i can piece together our friend here met a gentleman .
who was in town on a business venture and um
so they went out a few times but apparently when the fellow returned home he discovered that the benes tattoo does not wash off so easily .
so he 's coming in to stay with her for a week .
nice going . thank you that ought to get us a free dessert i think the busboy 's in trouble .
i did n't say anything .
he 'll probably kill his family over this .
a lot of ex cons become busboys . they seem to gravitate twards em .
maybe i 'll try that pesto .
look i feel bad for him too but he 'll get another job . i mean let 's face it it 's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews .
oh like you do .
camp .
elaine ?
busboys are always changing jobs . that 's the business . i know . i work with these guys . i tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs .
i 'd love to but i do n't know anything about him . he could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins .
no . so now you 're going to his apartment ? i really think this is nuts .
you you 're going now ?
maybe the fat camp . you 're not going ?
i just do n't think you should go alone . ca n't you wait till after my set ?
take the k man . a little support
george stop worrying about this guy . it was n't your fault come on he 's not stalking you .
hey . he does n't even know where you live who told you to give him your business card ? that 's elaine . kramer george wants to know when you want to look for the cat again .
kramer says it 's up to the cat now . it 'll be on your conscience .
how do you figure ? cause you 're the one who left the door open .
why was he in charge of closing the door ? cause you came in after him .
so . so the last person in should close the door .
talk call him from your house . he 's calling you now okay .
no hello ?
guarantee ? hey it 's a car .
so did you have a nice week together ?
there 's no ping . why are you so wacky ?
so you two been uh

oooh .
you still using that old alarm clock ?
flying does n't make me nervous driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you 're flying when you 're getting on the plane if you miss that plane there 's no alternative . on the ground you have options . you have buses you have taxis you have trains . but when you 're taking a flight if you miss it that 's it . no airline goes well you missed the flight we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes . would you be interested in that ? it 's not a direct cannon you have to change cannons after you land . i 'm sorry where you goin ? chicago ? oh dallas ? alright wait a second dallas . that 's about dallas . texas anyway . you should hit texas . are you ready ? make sure you get out of the net immediately because we shoot the luggage in right after you . '
anywhere in the city ?
okay fifty fourth and sixth ?
alright sixty fifth and tenth .
you do n't mean here ?
where are you going ?
no . you three all know each other . there 's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game .
he 'll get another job . he 's a busboy .
it was that fall down the stairs . that 's what did it .
yeah how ya doing ?
first of all i ca n't believe that people actually do fight . people have fist fights in life . i ca n't really believe that we have boxing either . it 's really kind of an amazing thing . to me the problem with boxing is you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument . why do n't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars drive around a bit have a little accident ? they get out did n't you see my signal ? look at that fender . then you 'd see a real fight .
what do you think the worst part of being blind is ?
you know if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be ?
i think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food . how could you ever enjoy a meal like that ? i 'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue .
you hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in pennsylvania ?
he was at a carnival with his mother . she goes to get a hot dog next thing you know she turns around boom he 's gone .
imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that . and these people are all over the place . you never know who 's crazy i could be one of these people .
who takes care of your boy during the day ?
no no . i 'm just saying .
oh i 'm sure she did i 'm sure they 're impeccable . i 'm talking about the ones that forge `em .
you know i think this is really helping .
so she 's giving me the massage and i 'm just making conversation .
neither do i but i do it for them . i figure they 're bored .
i 'm in the middle of a story .
well it 's not like it 's a really funny story or anything .
well so she mentioned that she had a son and then for some reason i launch into the story about the kid from pennsylvania who was abducted .
yes it was .
i know it was stupid .
hey i just said it was stupid .
take it .
hey would you stop it already ?
i do n't know she actually seemed to get a little paranoid .
nah she 's really good and she 's not just a masseuse she 's a physical therapist . there 's a big difference . she uses the ultrasound it 's a real medical procedure . in fact if you get a doctor 's note it 's covered by insurance .
yeah .
not if you have a doctor 's note .
well i 've never actually done it but if i really wanted to i could probably get one from my friend roy the dentist .
i 'll tell you but do n't ask her anything about her kid she a little off .
no appointments at all ? because my neck is still tight . what about thursday ? and friday ? oh boy . okay thanks anyway .
what 's with you ?
yes a ?
yes a man gave you ?
so ?
he was what ? .
that 's a massage .
you took your pants off ?
oh .
really ?
moved ?
i 'm sure it did n't move .
maybe it just wanted to change positions ? you know shift to the other side .
okay so what if it moved ?
that 's not the test . contact is the test if it moves as a result of contact .
that 's what a gym teacher once told me .
hey .
joe dimaggio ? in dinky donuts ?
no i 'm sorry if joe dimaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel . he 's not sitting in dinky donuts .
i ca n't see joe dimaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly dinky donuts .
he can have a donut
but not at dinky .
i never said i 'd do that .
i do n't know how i feel about it .
alright alright .
so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note and if you ca n't believe me it 's fine .
i mean if you feel funny about it at all .
if he does .
he feels funny . you do n't have to do this .
roy should we go ? is this a breach of our friendship ?
what is the matter with you ?
you do n't have to really .
we should probably get one for elaine too right george ? george ?
well what about the week after ?
no appointments at all ?
can i can i at least just talk to her so i can apologize ? forget it . i ca n't believe this i make one innocent comment about some lunatic in pennsylvania and i 'm cut off . this woman is insane . what 's with you ?
well you were too close to me i was all scrunched in there .
uh huh .
see now i know it 's not him . joe dimaggio could not be a dunker .
what happened to you ?
hello ? oh hi roy . what ? oh my god . wel how did this happen ? what can i do ? oh . i am so sorry . okay . bye . that was roy . he 's under investigation for insurance fraud .
i told you .
i told you we should n't do it .
he 's got a house a family they could take away his license . you should have heard him . three notes how stupid was that ? we never should have got three notes .
yeah you me and george .
yeah .
you what ?
why 'd you do that ?
of course i was getting you a note .
neither did you that 's how he got caught . we sent in four notes from two doctors .
hi pam .
i just thought ahh maybe i could talk to roy if um
hi roy .
i do n't even know what to say .
i knew this would happen .
i mean the whole thing it 's just
well it 's not tragic .
no it 's
okay . i mean what if the
i 'm not happy .
i mean i 'm happy sometimes but but not now .
yeah college was fun .
yeah .
oh please i love her .
well what 's the next move what 's going to happen now ?
what ? the physical therapist ? why ?
hi . ah look i know i do n't have an appointment but it 's really important that i talk with julianna .
yeah i know she 's mad at me but i really have to speak with her .
you do n't understand ah
wait a second do n't you
hi . hi . look i do n't know what you think
but you see let me just talk to you for a second see what i did is inadvertently sent an insurance
ca n't you just listen to me ?
the police ?
raymond ?
yeah i still do n't see any dinner invitations forthcoming .
hey it 's the k man . maybe it 's time you got a different hobby .
did he say anything ?
oh my god it 's
having a cup of coffee .
wow . look at him . the yankee clipper
here .
what causes homophobia ? what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry ? i think it 's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance . we 're constantly buying shoes that hurt us pants that do n't fit right . men think obviously i can be talked into anything . what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking it 's a shoe store and the salesman goes just hold this guy 's hand walk around the store a little bit see how you feel . no obligation no pressure just try it . would you like to see him in a sandal ? ''
these are the receipts from NUM and i 'm going to do NUM .
i do n't blame you . i blame myself .
ok i blame you .
what was i supposed to do ? you knew i was on my first date with elaine . you come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa .
i find the whole thing very embarrassing .
yeah tha 's easy when you have no income .
hi
kramer dating your room mate . it 's funny .
oh he 's uh helping me sort my receipts . i 'm being audited .
oh i contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent . it 's very boring .
uh along long time ago in a galaxy far far away .
volcano ? really ?
something to drink ?
you got it all wrong . i was thinking only of the poor krakatoans
those brave krakatoans east of java . who sacrifice so much for so long .
no that 's krama .
it 's all taken care of .
an old friend of mine whom you may have met george costanza has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the irs . and as we speak at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information . and she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise .
i do n't know . it must be love .
if this audit had happened to me and i did n't have this woman to help me i would have killed this man . i would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
have you ever been through an audit ?
it 's hell . it 's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination . i would have killed this man . torn him limb from limb ripped the flesh right off his bones
yeah
come up ah there he is the man himself george louis costanza . here i am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
and there 's so much more to go .
so what happened ? you gave her my tax papers ? my papers ?
what happened you did n't give her the papers ?
so ?
you what ?
i 'm being audited . and you broke up with her ?
why will she still do it ? she hates you now . people do n't do you favors after you dump them .
how is that possible ?
oh my god .
it 's unheard of
so you lie . what did you tell her ?
pretentious . ? the woman has my tax papers . you told her she was pretentious ? the irs . they 're like the mafia . they can take anything they want
ok wait a second wait a second what happened to my papers ?
yeah i know champagne limos cigars . what happened to the papers ?
is that relevant ? she took them . call her office .
what ? what ?
this is no good . this is no good . call her house .
not good .
not good
i can see that . what 's it for ?
yeah
come on up .
would n't it be invisible ? i mean what are you going to just sense it 's in front of the couch ?
what 's with you two ?
tell me what ?
completely naked ?
ok just a second lets not lose our heads here . kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as mr . johnson is concerned that 's another story .
you 'll sense it .
well what happened ? was she there ?
you did n't get my papers ?
well where is she ?
why is it so difficult uncomfortable to be naked . it 's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do you feel like you 're getting it together yeah yeah pretty good feeling good looking good but when you 're naked it 's like it 's so final you 're well that 's it . there 's nothing else i can do . that 's why i like to wear a belt when i 'm naked . cause i feel it gives me something i know i 'm naked but you know i like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be would n't that be the ultimate ? to be naked and still be able to do this i think that would really help a lot .
a mental institution ?
you know i hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my papers .
so what now ?
can we go out there ?
woodhaven .
my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time . he came over to my house for dinner . there was no soda and he went bezerk . he was screaming where 's the pepsi where 's the pepsi ? '
that 'd be great . there 's no wrong answer .
tuberculosis
leroy
tuberculosis
want want ? what could i possibly want ? uh i just came because i i heard so many nice things about you from george .
just chatting . friendly .
it 's one stupid thing after another . so let me ask you when you come to one of these places what do you bring your pocketbook ?
he 's never guiled . you know some women keep a lot of important papers in their uh pocket books . like for example oh someone else 's personal financial papers .
there are no copies .
who makes copies ?
yes i 'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that i bought there it was NUM i remember i talked to a guy he had like a maroon sport jacket and he might have had a toupee oh it was a weave ok uh then i 'll come bye ok bye .
anybody want to take a walk down to NUM street ? i think i may have tracked down another receipt .
george ?
you 're going by NUM st . you can give me a ride .
i was audited last year . at first i thought well irs kinda sounds like toys r us maybe wo n't be so bad . maybe they have a sense of fun about it you know . but it 's it 's bad . it 's an ordeal . and they do n't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal . i think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there . you know give me a feeling like you might win something . you know what i mean ? then they can pull them out one by one and go oh i 'm sorry that 's another illegal deduction . but we do have some lovely parting gifts for you . jail . '
hey there 's the old man .
ahh we waited NUM minutes in the rent a car place .
what 's the difference ?
i do n't want to use your car .
nothing . it 's a fine car . what if you want to use it ?
so what would you do ? you 'd hitch ?
i do n't know . NUM bucks a day .
oh i did n't get the insurance .
you 're not paying for it .
god it 's so hot in here . why do n't you put on the air conditioning ?
it 's not a speech . do i have to make a speech ?
oh yeah that will go over real well with that crowd .
the lake is n't real .
i 'm going to put elaine 's stuff in here .
ma .
what about you ?
what about him ?
na that 's not such a good idea .
not now . she 's right inside .
i do n't know . we decided we do n't really work as a couple .
well
shh . nothing nothing .
but you know look at the sun dried tomatoes . where were they five years ago ? it just goes to show you . you never know what huh you know huh what could happen to a vegetable . it could just take right off at any time . we 've tried all kind of arrangements but we ca n't seem to be friends when we sleep together .
i 'm looking . that 's the point . i like looking .
i 'm going for the record .
oh come on .
nice to see you . this is elaine .
we 're going scuba diving . we 'll be back in time .
for fun .
i do n't think so .
what kind of pen is that ?
yeah .
wow . that 's the astronaut pen . i heard about that . where did you get it ?
cause sometimes i write in bed and i have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work .
oh no .
i could n't
i ca n't take it .
no i 'm not
i cannot take it .
are you sure ?
ok thank you very much . thank you . gee boy .
thanks again .
what he gave it to me .
he offered it to me .
i liked it . should i have said i did n't like it ?
he could have said thank you i like it too and put it back in his pocket .
if he likes it so much he never should have offered it .
well he was wrong .
so you want me to return it ?
hey i do n't even want the pen now .
are you ok in here ?
it 's only for three days . today 's over and we have tommorow . we leave on sunday . it 's one day really .
oh you want to switch ? i 'm sleeping on a love seat . i 've got my feet up in the air like i 'm in a space capsule .
oh no do n't say that . you 'll jinx me .
they 're nuts with temperature .
how about that guy writing a check for NUM . NUM ?
it 's one day . half a day really . i mean you substract showers and meals it 's like twenty minutes . it will go by like that .
stay on biscayne .
yes . generally that 's where scuba diving is done .
what 's so special up here ?
then you would be hunched over .
you ca n't go ?
without you ? that 's the whole reason you came down here .
you sure ?
we 'll stay in a hotel tonight .
why do n't you get a new sofa ?
i 'm buying you a new sofa .
hi . how are you ?
evelyn this is elaine .
too thin ?
what ?
i never really wanted the pen .
no no i
all i said was i like the peng .
do n't be alarmed .
i 'm ok my capillaries burst .
how are you doing ?
is it my imagination or is it freezing in here ?
well i started to go under
yeah and i got about ten feet down and i felt this tremendous pressure on my mask . like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets .
i got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool .
listen m . klompus it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen but i do n't really need it .
i mean it 's a terrific pen but i think you should keep it .
take it .
what is going on in this community . are you people aware of what 's happening ? what is driving you to this behavior ? is it the humudity ? is it the muzak ? is it the white shoes ?
is n't he supposed to be the emcee ?
well . this should be a very interesting evening .
you took too many of those pills .
oh god .
uncle leo .
i 've got a black eye .
oh uh elaine this is my aunt stella .
her back hurts .
no no .
dad .
i ca n't . nobody 's even listening .
oh god . huh hey . how you folks doing tonight ?
have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes ?
who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut ?
all i said was i liked the pen .
there must be some mistake .
well there 's really no point in me staying . i mean you just going to be
nothing .
hi evelyn .
well today 's almost over . and weekdays always go by fast . friday we 're leaving . it 's like two days really . it 's like a cup of coffee . it will go by like that .
is florida not hot and muggy enough for these people ? they love heat . i mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun i think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it . they 'll just sit there on the sun on the redwood benches washcloth on the head going close the door you 're letting all the heat off the sun . i 'm trying to get a sweat going . '
so i 'm on the plane we left late . pilot says we 're going to be making up some time in the air . i thought well is n't that interesting . we 'll just make up time . that 's why you have to reset your watch when you land . of course when they say they 're making up time obviously they 're increasing the speed of the aircraft . now my question is if you can go faster why do n't you just go as fast as you can all the time ? c 'mon there 's no cops up here nail it . give it some gas . we 're flying .
is he on the plane now ?
uh just my next door neighbor .
howbout picking up their you know . you find that enriching ?
what 's the matter ?
huh ? how you feeling ?
farfel ?
the dog ? the dog ?
but you know what if you know ?
the dog ?
let go farfel . let go gimme that . gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot . shut up . so what would you do ?
stop it . shut uuuuuup . do you believe this ? do you believe what i 'm dealing with here i 've got a wild animal in the house . he 's deranged maybe he 's got rabies . i can get lockjaw .
look at this place . he 's going everywhere i ca n't go out of the house at night . i have n't performed in three days . this 'll be my first night out of the house since i got back .
do i what ?
yes i pick it up .
well you have to .
shut up . shut up farfel stop it . i do n't know what to do . i mean what if i take it to the pound then the guy shows up ?
no i tried . they do n't know anything . you got to put the syrup in first .
i 'm telling you the guy 's a drunk he 's probably on a bender .
i do n't know they drink and they bend things at the bar .
two hundred seats on a plane i got to wind up next to yukon jack and his dog cujo . shut up . one more day and you are pound bound .
why ?
you 're breaking up ?
i ca n't believe someone has n't killed her yet .
well you ca n't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them .
you . i 'm talking about people .
no i ca n't i got to watch farfel you and george can go without me .
sure .
what do you need me for ?
no i ca n't trust him he gets insane . i wo n't enjoy myself . that 's right farfel i 'm talking about you .
i ca n't go .
because i have to watch idiot farfel .
he 's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight .
no i do n't want that smell in the house .

nah . you two go .
go ahead .
i want to but i ca n't .
no .
forget it . go ahead you 'll have a good time .
well thank you very much . i 'm telling you one more day stinkbreath .
on my block a lot of ah people walk their dogs and i always see them walking along with their little poop bags which to me is just the lowest function of human life . if aliens are watching this through telescopes they 're going to think the dogs are the leaders . if you see two life forms one of them 's making a poop the other one 's carrying it for him who would you assume was in charge ?
bad dog . bad dog . you go outside . outside . what do you want from me ? tell me . money you want money ? i 'll give you money how much ? .
that 's right gavin palone . what ? are you sure ? he was released on monday ? last monday ? did he leave a phone number or address ? unbelievable . well thank you thanks thanks very much . that 's it farfel . party 's over . start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy you 're checking out .
oh one on one 's a whole different game . ca n't pass off .
going to the dog pound everybody . going to the dog pound come on down . what ?
what am i supposed to do ? i do n't want to do it . i like dogs . i 'm not sure this is a dog .
i 'm in the book and i have a machine .
really ? how late are they open ?
what ?
yeah i really think you guys are good together .
well i was just trying to be supportive you know . i knew you were upset .
what are you doing ?
kramer ? what did we say that 's so bad ?
i said how come no one 's killed her ? probably should n't have said anything
well .
everyone knows the first break up never takes . yeah ?
okay farfel put your shoes on .
it 's not my dog i do n't know where this boozehound is .
i ca n't let you do that what about prognosis negative ?
well we 'll go see something else tonight . we 'll see uh ponce de leon .
she talked me into one more day . talk amongst yourselves i 'm going to go to the bathroom .
i do n't know regular human time ?
why should n't i go here ?
oh yeah urinals are fun . can i go ? .
so what are calling me six times a day ?
i could read the sports section if my hair was on fire .
it is ? oh yeah you 're right . what else is playing ?
boy i know she really wants to see that with me .
i do n't know what to do .
i know i know .
it is kind of silly .
i mean it 's just a movie for godo s sake .
it 's not like she 's in the movie .
am i supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it ? i mean if i could have seen it with her fine . but i ca n't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples availabilities at movies .
how does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment ? you ca n't talk during a movie . you know this is stupid c 'mon let 's just go .
saving movies .
two for prognosis negative . i 'm in big trouble .
you know it 's interesting because i called the hospital and they said you were released on monday .
oh hi ellen .
listen it 's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week but if you do n't mind
prediction . i never see you or him again for the rest of my life .
why do n't we just rent a movie ?
no it&macNUM s it 's supposed to be really bad really bad . i mean it 's long there 's no story it 's so unbelievably boring i heard . i
well george told me the whole story line for line i mean i almost feel like i 've seen it already and walked out on it .
you and george got together ?
hello .
what 's up ?
about what ?
too bad .
prognosis negative .
it 's not .
i have an instinct for these things .
i had a parakeet when i was a kid that was the only pet that i really enjoyed . we used to let him out of his cage and he would fly around and my mother had built one entire wall of our living room was mirrored . she felt this gives you a feeling of space . have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room ? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes hey look there 's a whole nother room in there . there 's a guy in there looks just like me . but the parakeet will fall for this you 'll let him out of his cage he flies around the room bang . with his little head he would just go click ohh . and i 'd always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room why does n't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet ?
let me speak with the head librarian . because it 's absurd . an overdue book from NUM ? this is a joke right ? what are you ? from a radio station ?
ya got me i fell for it . alright ok i can be down there in like a half hour . bye .
this you 're not going to believe . the nypl says that i took out tropic of cancer in NUM and never returned it .
it does n't work like that .
it 's not going to be anything . i returned the book . i remember it very vividly because i was with sherry becker . she wore this orange dress . it was the first time i ever saw her in a dress like that . in oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years . and then one day
that orange dress is burned in my memory
i wonder what ever happened to her .
oh computers they 're cracking down now on overdue books . the whole thing is completely ridiculous .
it 's george . wait til he hears we 're going to the library
coming down .
i got to go to the library . you want to go ?
where 's george
i kinda like those sticks . i 'd like to get them in my house .
this woman 's completely ignoring me .
eventually a little shot of penicillin
yeah i called before . i got his notice in the mail .
can i speak with this bookman ?
what ?
who ?
yeah .
haymen are you sure ?
george got him fired . he squealed on him .
oh he sang like a canary .
not here ? why was i told to come down here ?
well what am i supposed to do now ?
all right thanks . come on lets go
so they forgot to get your lunch . big deal .
i remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class . and the straps were hanging down by his
i had him for hygene . remember his teeth . it was like from an exhumed corpse .
echh
he got fired the next day .
they also have an atomic wedgie . now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head . very rare .
well what do girls do ?
what 's amazing to me about the library is it 's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you 're done . it reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend . that 's what the library is . a government funded pathetic friend . and that 's why everybody kinds of bullies the library . i 'll bring it back on time i 'll bring it back late . oh what are you going to do ? charge me a nickel ?
oh i 'm glad you 're here so we can get this all straightened out . would you like a cup of tea ?
coffee ?
no i do n't drink coffee .
no i do n't have
well i do n't normally
i do n't .
really ? i 'll have to remember that .
yes and i returned it in NUM .
look mr . bookman . i i returned that book . i remember it very specifically .
i try .
no i do n't .
certainly not .
no way i 'm paying that . i returned that book in NUM . i have a witness sherry becker . she wore an orange dress . she gave me a piece of black jack gum . it 's a licorice gum . what do ya think of next i remember it . becker becker
so sherry what do you remember about that day at the library ?
purple ? ya sure it was n't orange ?
no black jack ?
tropic of cancer .
tropic of capricorn ?
wait a second . wait a second . you 're right . i had both of them .
george here 's the book . do n't let anybody see it . do n't let anything happen to it .
ok i 'll see you after school . i . m late for hayman 's hygiene .
it was nice seeing you again . i just remembered something . i 've got to go . it was george .
maybe you 're getting a raise .
wait til i tell him about the book .
i 'm right here .
columbus euro trash .
that was double overtime .
so georgie boy guess what happened to tropic of cancer
because i gave it to you .
yeah think . do n't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally i agreed . you were supposed to return it . i met you in the gym locker room .
here 's the book . do n't let anybody see it . do n't let anything happen to it .
all right i 'll see you after school . i m late for hayman 's hygiene .
anyway i hope there 's no hard feelings .
what is your problem ?
that is one tough monkey . so you were saying ?
oh beautiful did he like them ?
was he out there ?
i guess we 'll never know .
any day that you had gym it was a weird school day you know what i mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal . you have like english geometry social studies and then suddenly you 're like in lord of the flies for NUM minutes you know you 're hanging from a rope . you have hardly any clothes on . teachers are yelling at ya where 's your jock strap ? ya know and kids are throwing dodge balls at you . you 're trying to survive then its history science language . there 's something off in the entire flow of that day .
why do i always have the feeling that everybody 's doing something better than me on saturday afternoons ?
no they do n't . they 're out on some big picnic . they 're cooking burgers . they 're making out on blankets . they 're not at some mall in jersey watching their friends trying to find the worldo s cheapest air conditioner .
big accomplishment .
five o'clock .
you 're not late .
of course we 'll hit traffic . it 's rush hour .
there is no other way in new york . everybody goes every way all the time .
you got the picnic and burger traffic .
i have to go to the bathroom . why do they hide the bathroom in these malls ?
you want me to help you with that ?
what do you think georgie boy ?
i thought it was green . i remember seeing green .
it 's over there . i know where it is .
there it is . no no that 's a toyota .
hmmm i thought it was
i thought it was over there .
i really have to go to the bathroom .
i 'll wait .
alright .
maybe i should just go anytime i get the urge like you wherever i am . there 's too much urinary freedom in this society . i 'm proud to hold it in . it builds character .
will you let me help you with that ?
you 're not worried somebody 's going to pee on it ?
parents never forget a foul up . i once left a jacket on the bus when i was fourteen . last week i 'm flying to chicago to do a show make sure you hang on to your jacket . '
maybe it 's not on this level .
there are four different levels . maybe we 're on the wrong level . how long was the escalator ride up ?
you should always carry a pad and pen .
where was the bathroom in this mall ? there are six hundred stores i did n't see one bathroom . what is this like a joke ? they finished building the mall and they go oh my god we forgot the bathrooms . '
all right that 's it . from now on no more calling out they found it unless we 're sitting in it . okay ?
his eyes look a little cloudy .
who 's got the tickets ? george i do . i thought you knew this mall . you said you 'd been here before .
no one 's going to do that .
those are really ugly sneakers . where did you get those ?
it 's amazing how shopping makes me have to go . all i have to do is walk into a department store and it 's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in .
i know .
no i ca n't .
you think i 'm too cautious ?
organic . so 's buddy hackett .
he 's a comedian .
all right . all right .
i can manage .
okay okay . i 'll be right back .
but
kramer
i 've had this condition since i was eleven . i 've been in and out of hospitals my whole life . i have no control over it . doctors have told me that when i feel it the best thing to do is just release it . otherwise i could die .
do you hear what i 'm saying to you ? . i 'm telling you that if i do n't go i could die . die . is it worth dying for ?
so you do n't care if i die .
it was life and death .
oh i 'm lying . why would i do it unless i was in mortal danger ? i know it 's against the law .
because i could get uromysitisis poisoning and die . that 's why . do you think i enjoy living like this ? the shame the humiliation you know i have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition . unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning .
him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place . you want to call the department of social services ? oh it 's saturday . they 're closed today . my luck .
first of all you do n't even know technically that i went . that 's for starters . i mean i couldo ve been pouring a bottle of water out there . you do n't know .
oh really do you ? well it just so happens that i did pour water out . i had a bottle of very tepid water and i poured it out . and i could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating .
and you know when you think about it it 's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity . that 's all it is .
you know this is not the first time this has happened to me . i always carry water because of my condition . it dehydrates me . it 's a vicious cycle .
all right all right . i want to apologize . i was frightened i said crazy things . i obviously offended you . i insulted your intelligence . the uromysitisis the water bottle i made it all up and now i 'm going to tell you the truth . today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth well i 'm jumping ahead here their forty seventh wedding anniversary . we made arrangements to spend the evening together . they are supposed to be in front of my building at six fifteen .
what i have n't told you or anyone else for that matter is that my father 's been in a red chinese prison for the past fourteen years .
was he also in a red chinese prison ?
well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of red china 's great military leaders general chang who by the way came up with the recipe for general chang 's chicken . you know the one with the red peppers and orange peel at szechwan gardens ? george sure i have it all the time . very spicy .
well general chang was a very flamboyant man . a complete failure as a general but a helluva cook .
i was arrested for urinating .
i have uromysitisis . it 's very serious you know .
no but he 's not looking good
hey where 's kramer ?
where 's kramer ?
hey george there she is again .
ask her to drive us around . there 's your opening .
filthy pigs .
jerry .
boy those scientologists . they can be pretty sensitive .
the car .
kramer .
kramer .
yeah over here .
this is amazing i have n't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened . poor guy .
what 's that smell ? what are you wearing ?
manly .
so why did n't you say no ?
look at this poor guy . his family is probably in pakistan they 're waiting him to send back money . this is horrible .
that 's because you 're stupid enough to wear the cologne .
i 've never been a guinea pig . i 've been a sheep a tody .
all right i 'm sorry . go ahead you 're taking the iq test .
who thinks you 're smart ?
what thing ?
oh oh the iq thing yeah .
what 'd ya get ?
what do you say ?
NUM that 's a good score .
what did you really get ?
of course .
i hope so .
he 's serving mexican italian chinese . he 's all over the place . that 's why no one 's going in .
i do n't know i 'm obsessed with it . it 's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival . and even though ya know he 's not going to make it y y you kind of root for him for a second .
well it 's a spider .
bazooka joe .
the buzzer .
my house ? you got to be on the lease to press to buzzer . yeah ?
come on up .
what 's that ?
come on go in go in .
no i 'm afraid we 'll start talking and i 'll going to wind up going partners with him .
you know i could probably shoot him from here . i 'd be doing us both a favor .
casus belli .
hey how 'd you do on that iq test ?
oh it 's nothing
why must you always be the focal point of attention ? why ca n't you just be ? why ca n't you live ?
this woman he 's dating is making him take this iq test for this course .
no see he 's not smart . people think he 's smart but he 's not .
you know i do n't even know my iq .
get out of here .
you get out of here .
boy that 'd be something cheating on a iq test .
hey remember in college when you passed lettick the test out the window ? you became a legend after that .
take it to dream cafe you wo n't hear a peep .
hey i love a good caper .
well ah i 've been looking forward to it .
eh people people are talking .
ah non smoking would be great .
thank you .
well ah w what do you recommend my good fellow ?
well then the turkey it 'll be . and may i say you have a splendid establishment here my friend . i 'm sure you flourish at this location for many many years .
very kind . i am a kind man . who else would do something like this ? nobody . nobody thinks about people the way i do . all right snap out of it you stupid jerk . you 're eating a turkey sandwich . what do want a nobel prize ?
thank you babu . you have quite a flair . you are quite the restaurateur i must say .
oh please
eat something . babu
oh wow so you got the test . you 're cheating .
hey .
so ?
why not ?
statute .
statute of limitations . it 's not a statue .
fine it 's a sculpture of limitations .
oh my god .
go ahead i 'll take care of it .
it 's all right she was cheating anyway .
babu you 're pakistani right ?
babu may i say something ?
i am not a restaurateur by any means but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native pakistan ? as opposed to say t the franks and beans for example .
does n't matter . you would have the only authentic pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood .
well you know not everything . i do what i can .
the average person in a situation like this they walk right by it . not me .
of course i always do .
hey georgie .
how 'd you do on the iq test ? .
what ? .
well well well
well i 'm no genius but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds .
well maybe the test was gender bias you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles
but an NUM ?
take it here i 'll leave there 'll be no distractions .
well congratulations my friend . you know i 'm sorry i missed the grand re opening . i was out of town for about a week .
i think it 's fantastic . has a certain indefinable charm .
let me tell you something babu . you go back in that kitchen tell your chef i want the works .
babu ? babu babu you know i got to tell you i never do this but the shrimp it 's just it 's a little stringy . you have any chicken ?

well this type of things is very common when you 're in show business .

why are you doing this ?
elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man ?
you know what that makes you ? a baldist .
well yes i did that 's true . a couple of a guys i knew in the coastguard told me about her and i sensed that she had the anger and intensity that i needed to make this film work .

there . so how did it go ?
oh uh i think maybe dick picked up yours .
i did n't know you meant hold it i thought you meant hold it .
i never feel comfortable in the women 's department . i feel like i 'm just a little too close to trying on a dress .
hey the woman got you a job . the least you could do is buy her a gift . how about this ?
yeah . she would love cashmere .
look at this . it 's NUM dollars marked down from NUM .
oh it 's damaged .
it 's hard to say .
well i can see it .
well what do you want me to do ? not look at it ?
it 's hard to pretend because i know where it is .
you want me to take an overview ?
i see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something . that 's my overview .
yeah so ?
oh boy can you smell it ?
well if you ca n't smell it then he has n't been drinking .
yes you do .
yes you would .
i 'll prove it . would you do me a favor ?
would you take a drink and let us smell you ?
i got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me . it 's hennigans . it 's been here for two years . i 've been using it as a paint thinner .
i do n't smell anything .
yeah .
come on up .
kramer . yeah that 'll do .
i tried to stop him . i could n't . he just wants to make people happy .
uh i do n't know . uh i do n't know .
i do n't know .
ahem . say that again ?
do i see it or do n't i ? that 's the question .
now what did you ask me again .
you had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk ? who are you how did you do that ?
yeah chambermaids i 'm attracted to them too .
it 's a woman in your room . so go ahead .
convulsing ?
i do n't know i 'm trying to help you .
you do n't drink .
so you started drinking .
so how was it ?
good thing the cleaning lady was there .
you mean to tell me if i had put that drink six inches over to the right and none of this would have happened .
what are you saying ?
you 're saying something .
well you 're not saying nothing you must be saying something .
well why do n't you say it ?
what did you say ?
yeah ?
come on up .
no i did n't .
i did n't have an expression . i have a deviated septum . i have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe .
frankly i am shocked that you would ask such a question of me that you would think the only surprise is how you could even think of that . that 's what you were seeing .
elaine is in the bathroom . she 's wise to whole red dot thing . she 's asking me all kinds of questions .
no .
i 'm not swearing . i do n't want to swear .
no .
i did n't tell her you stupid idiot . she tricked you .
i was in the men 's room the other day and they had the hand blower instead of the paper towels you know this thing . i like the hand blower i have to say . it takes a little bit longer but i feel when you 're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can .
oh wait a second i believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen . hey dick i do n't know what your problem is . it 's not my fault you 're back on the wagon .
in the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town ?
on the wagon . do n't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way ?
they had smooth trails . what about the cumberland gap ?
i know enough not to get on them .
george ?
george ?
i 'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up .
i would say when the nipple makes its first appearance .
nice try . so guess who heckled me at the club last night .
get off of me .
but in a way i think i inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic . i hate being around alcoholics because they 're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you . and those are the two statements that scare me the most . but i think he 's okay now because i have no idea how he feels about me . he 's finally off the wagon .
do n't get smart .
remember do n't whistle on the elevator .
that 's what willie loman told biff before his interview in death of a salesmang .
what time is the lesbian wedding ?
i 'm so tired . i 'll fall asleep on that train
oh i 'm paying for breakfast ?
why do i always pay ? what am i made of money ? you bunch of deadbeats .
so can i convince anybody to come down to coney island with me ? i got to pick up my car at the pound . george ?
not only that they found it . it was simonized and the front end was aligned .
so what do you say ? run in the cyclone . hotdogs on nathan 's is on me .

kramer bumper cars ?
could be years before i get back to coney island . i ca n't go to rides alone .
o k . you realize of course you 're naked ?
you oughta sit here . there is a difference .
i got something against yours . how about a couple of deep knee bends maybe a squat thrust ?
all right how about skipping breakfast . i 'm guessing you 're not a half grapefruit and black coffee guy .
i understand i like good breakfast . long as you do n't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails been counseled by dick gregory .
that 's your problem you should be .
do n't get up please allow me .
i 'm not worried about their best pitching . they got pitching . they got no hitting .
defence ? please . they need speed .
franco 's no good ? they got no team leaders .
but you got to like their chances .
tell you what . if they win the penant i 'll sit naked with you at the world series .
first we ride the cyclone .
aah french fries .
no i never got the car . we were having such a good time by the time i got to the police garage it was closed .
you would n't believe what this guy put away at nathan 's . look at what we won .
you want him ?
so you missed the wedding . you 'll catch the bris .
biff what did you whistle on the elevator ?
yeah it 's in the kitchen drawer .
come on i 'll go with you .
were you talking ? i could n't hear anything .
oh noel . yeah the one who plays bongos
all right i 'm sorry . what about her ?
i know you told me you like her everything is going good .
we all want the hand . hand is tough to get . you got to get the hand right from the opening .
yeah that sounds like something
that smells good what is that ?
the beach ?
you joined the polar bears ? .
yeah so 's shock therapy .
what is that a pez dispenser ? .
you do n't know ?
you think they have fleas there do n't you ?
yes you do biff . you 've never been to a flea market and you think they have fleas there .
they have a piano backstage they warm up on .
what do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out ?
i resent that you said that . that 's directed at me is n't it ? .
is this okay ? can i do this ?
i dunno it was an impulse .
how could i know she would start to laugh ?
can we just go in already ?
what about ?
i know but i 'm distracted now .
really john mollika they guy that used to bartend at the comedy club . how 's he doing ?
cut to the chase ?
what 're you joe hollywood ?
i would lose that .
lose that ? that 's not a hollywood expression .
really an intervention
me ? why me ?
y'know these things are really hard to load
we 've got to talk about this
you play a hell of a piano .
pez ?
anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway . i mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant .
even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she 's still the one who laughed .
we 'll be outside
it was nice meeting you by the way how do you warm up your fingers before you play ?
you know i thing kramer might have been responsible for getting richie involved with drugs in the first place .
a few years ago the comedy club had a softball team . kramer was our first baseman you could n't get anything by him it was unbelievable . anyway this one game we came back to win from like NUM runs behind . so kramer says to richie why do n't you dump the bucket of gatorade on marty benson 's head ? the club owner . so richie goes ahead and does it .
what happened ? the guy was like NUM years old it was freezing out he caught a cold got pneumonia and a month later he was dead .
all the comedians were happy . he was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway . but richie was never the same .
he 's the same .
are you sure you want me john . i have spoken to richie in two years . i do n't have a good apartment for an intervention . the furniture it 's very non confrontational . all right all right . goodbye . remember ricie appel ?
right we 'll john mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him . we 're having it here .
what do you think ? it 's like a poker game ?
yeah
yeah but john invited her .
no intervene go intervene all you want . i am just afraid you might be interfering while we 're intervening .
stop smelling your arm .
hum a cologne that smells like the beach . i ca n't believe i 'm saying this that 's not a bad idea . '
why do n't you call steve do jiff he works in the marketing department at calvin klein . in fact he 's a good friend of john mollika and richie also .
she broke up with you ?
what was on the list ?
yeah postum is under ratted
what 's wrong with lunch ?
a preemptive breakup .
in the freezer .
well i guess there are n't any ice cubes .
do i have to talk ? i do n't feel like talking .
hey .
intervention .
no we 're having an intervention
there 's a friend of ours on drugs and we 're going to confront him .
it 's not a surprise party . yeah
yeah come on up . it 's not him .
we 're having the intervention for richie .
well uh
well you 're looking well .
i did n't know she would laugh .
hey richie
it was pretty ugly from the get go . he 's not listening he 's hostile he 's talking back .
so he starts to get up he spots the pez dispenser on the coffee table
he picks it up he stares at it it 's like he 's hypnotized by it . then he 's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father and his father was trying to load one of them
tell me something i do n't know . so as the father 's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria . nobody 's hurt but pez is all over the car . and the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition .
so as he 's telling the story he starts crying .
what do you think ? i gave him my pez dispenser .
two hours later he checks into smither 's clinic . i talked to the doctor yesterday . he 's doing great on the rehab . he 's hooked on pez . he 's eating them like there 's no tomorrow .
i ca n't do those things .
let me ask you a question . if you named a kid rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life ?
what are you doing ? we 're going out for dinner in ten minutes .
yeah .
come on up . . . . i never heard of this . you 've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test . how you going to do that ?
i think i 'll take out the garbage .
well once i did n't have dinner until like NUM NUM o'clock that was pretty rough . hey do me a favour will ya ? throw out my garbage for me .
come on it 's just down the hall .
i 'll give you NUM cents .
come on . fifty cents . a piece of drake 's coffee cake
i do n't get you . who goes on vacation without a job ? what do you need a break from getting up at eleven ?
nah i do n't go for these non refundable deals . i ca n't commit to a woman . i 'm not going to commit to an airline .
hi .
gina do you know what a drake 's coffee cake is ?
how much do they cost ?
no no the junior .
really ? you should be ashamed of yourself . i want you out of here . how ya doing ?
boy she 's sexy is n't she ?
do you believe that guy ?
my neighbour
yeah did he think i was flirting with her ?
what 's so amazing ? you 've seen him before .
what was the dream ?
i think i 've played there .
you 're a little paranormal
psychics vacations . how about getting a job ?
alright come on lets get out of here .
i heard he used to polish off a box of triscuits .
oh yeah . ghandi loved triscuits .
who is it ? who is it ?
who ?
martine ?
oh martin .
what ?
in my pajamas ? i better get my robe .
it 'll take two seconds .
we do n't have two seconds ?
nah forget it .
nah . i 'll just wear the pajamas .
are you sure ?
nah i 'll go get the robe .
that 's not too bad . it 's not like a sunny von bulow comma . the doctor said he should snap out of it anytime .
really ? it 's over ?
oh boy did he say anything about me ?
he said that ?
i 'm sorry if i caused any trouble . i was just being friendly .
you were n't ?
of course .
are you sure he ca n't hear anything ? . . . martin martin .
i would i would wait on that . i know how you feel but . juries today you never know how they 're going to look at a thing like this .
no i just wanted to see what time it was .
no .
here ?
is this the proper venue ?
no no i want to . i i very much want to . i i desire to . i i pine to .
i ca n't . what if he wakes up ?
a man who respects a good comma . if it was one of those in and out comas maybe . but when a guy 's got a coma going like this you do n't want to mess with it .
hey .
yeah i heard .
who told you about martin ?
hey let me ask you something . how long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex girlfriend out ?
you know i do n't get that whole suicide machine . there 's no tall buildings where these people live ? they ca n't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person ?
well i went with her to the hospital last night .
so we 're in the room and she 's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him .
nothing .
i did n't know what the coma etiquette was .
so you 're saying his girl his car his clothes it 's all up for grabs . you can just loot the coma victim .
so if the coma victim wakes up in a month he 's thrilled he got out of the coma . he goes home there 's nothing left ?
you can say what you want about me but i 'll be damned if i 'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush .
no more like the three stooges at the end of every movie .
they 're a comedy team .
well they 're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot .
i will show you the stooges .
well i do n't really know where the stooges are right now but if i locate them you will be the first to know .
well uh i uh i do n't want you to get upset or anything but uh with martin and all well maybe it 's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building because you know he had a lot of friends here .
well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet ?
yeah all right . all right .
hello newman .
do you think newman would tell martin if he wakes up ? what kind of sicko would do that ? he could kill me .
boy it 's a good thing we came .
george i want you to promise me something . if i 'm ever in a comma . in the first NUM hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage .
looters .
she 's really hungry .
hello .
how 's he doing ?
why would n't he ?
he 'll have a lot of catching up to do i guess .
how up to date ?
and nothing could change your mind ?
drake 's coffee cake
from my house . i got a whole box of them .
that 's your big boy .
i do n't give out bites . i got another one . but i 'm saving it for later .
i do n't think so . you know they they 're so fragile .

oh yes you will .
yeah maybe you wo n't .

look at my hands . look . filthy from the paper . you know they should give you a wet nap when you buy one like at those rib joints .
went out with george you ?
how was it ? what 'd you talk about ?
we brushed on that . actually george was in rare form . he just ca n't find anybody .
george too .
i 've never fixed anybody up .
well why would n't you start with george ? you think she 's too good for george ?
well you implied it .
because if you think she 's too good for george you are dead wrong . dead wrong . who is she ?
he 's george .
so what ?
i do n't know what 's with the eyebrows ?
i went out with you .
well let me tell you something about george . he is fast . he can run like the wind . and he 's strong . i 've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it . and you would n't know it to look at him but george can bait a hook .
come on let 's do it i think they 'll really get along .
yeah come on it 's a good match .

oh i know her . i know her type .
the type that does n't return phone calls . i knew we should n't have done this it was a bad idea in the first place i told you .
i was just trying to help your bitter twisted friend .
well bitter 's a judgement call but she 's twisted .
i thought you said they had a good time is there anything else you 're keeping from me ?
i 'm calling you one if you are one are you a liar ?
get your finger out of my face .
i do n't care .

i have to dribble if i give it to you you just shoot . you 're a chucker .
that 's right everytime you get the ball you shoot .
you chuck .
well it 's not an easy thing to bring up .
believe me i did n't see anything .
no did you ?
why ?
i made a conscious effort not to look . there 's certain information i just do n't want to have .
all right
all right
you know who that is ? that 's
yeah that 's him .
positive .
yeah he 's a real smart guy too . he 's a civil war buff .
so biff wants to be a buff ? well sleeping less than NUM hours a day would be a start .
hey should we say something to him ?
well he could say hello to me . i would n't mind .
so ?
i know what he is . i recognized him . you did n't even notice him .
really ?
what i do ? you are one of my favorite ball players of all time
thank you .
i 'm performing in this club on the east side . you should come in .
i 'll tell you what i 'll give you my number and uh just give me a call tell me whenever you want to go .
oh . that would be great .
it 's been three days and he has n't called .
i ca n't i ca n't
i do n't know . i just feel he should call me .
you do n't understand elaine . i do n't want to be overanxious . if he wants to see me he has my number he should call .
i ca n't stand these guys . you give your number to them and then they do n't call . why do they do that ?
i mean i thought he liked me . i really thought he liked me . we were getting along . he came over to me i did n't go over to him .
why did he come over to me if he did n't want to see me ?
what did he come over to me if he did n't want to see me ? i mean here i meet this guy this great guy a baseball player best guy i ever met in my life . well that 's it . i 'm never giving my number out to another guy again .
hu good good well if he 's calling in a month he 's got a prayer .
oh they do n't have phones out of town ? why do people say they 're too busy . too busy . pick up a phone . it takes two minutes . how can you be too busy ?
i ca n't call here it 's a coffee shop . i mean what am i going to say to him ?
for what dinner ?
do n't you think that 's coming on a little too strong ? is n't that like a turn off ?
this is all very confusing .
elaine how about this shirt ? is this okay ?
oh see the baby again with the baby
uh he 's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby .
ya got to see the babi when are ya going to see the babi ca n't they just send us a tape ?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up .
hey kramer what do you think of this shirt ?
i know he 's just a guy but i like him .
uh keith uh hernandez .
hellooo newman .
unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account . allow me to reconstruct this if i may for miss benes as i 've heard this story a number of times .
newman kramer if you 'll indulge me . according to your story keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple . the spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking newman between the third and forth rib . the spit then cam off the rib turned and hit newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap . the spit then splashed off the wrist pauses in mid air mind you makes a left turn and lands on newman 's left thigh . that is one magic luggie .
what happened to your head when you got hit ?
again
back and to the left back and to the left
i am saying that the spit could not have come from behind that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road . if the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward .
but that is not what they would have you believe .
the sad thing is we may never know the real truth .
no . what happened to you ?
i 'm vandelay industries ?
and what is that ?
latex ? and what do i do with latex ?
and what do i say about you ?
i 'm going to hire you as my latex salesman ?
i do n't think so . why would i do that ?
if you think i 'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around you can forget it . i have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff .
yeah .
all right we 're coming down .
yeah come on elaine lets go .
that 's what i 've been trying to figure out the past five years .
well that was really fun thanks .
well
no i have n't .
sure that would be great .
i mean if you want to .
yeah friday 's okay .
well good night
elaine ?
uh i do n't know we used to go out .
for a date ?
oh no uh go ahead . you got a pen ?

so then we went to dinner .
we split it .
naw i got to wait until its just the right time .
yeah
come on up .
uh nuthing . then he took me home .
yeah
good shake . perfect shake . single pump not too hard you know does n't have to prove anything but you know firm enough to know he was there .
he asked me if i was doing anything friday night .
so then as i was getting out of the car
hi elaine .
what date ? it 's a guy .
already ?
i do n't mind at all . why should i mind ? what did he say ?
oh ya going ?
ah really .
friday ?
he 's going out with you on friday ?
he 's supposed to see me on friday .
we made plans .
no do n't cancel it .
well frankly it is .
well you 're not even a fan . i was at game six you did n't even watch it .
any hennigans around here ?
vandelay industries kel varnsen speaking . may we help you ? oh hi keith . na i was just joking around
no . no . i do n't mind at all .
sure we can do something next week .
no its no problem at all .
okay take it easy . that was keith . we 're going to do something next week .
hey what are you doing friday night ?
friday night ? nothin' now .
fasten your seat belts . we 're going to see the baby .
all right i 'll go
and you want to be my latex salesman .
hello . how are you
yes . i do love her . you have a very nice place here .
he 's joking .
i was saying the same thing .
uh you do n't have to take a picture .
jerry you want to pick her up ?
i better not .
i do n't know him . i know who he is .
i know . he got the hit in game six . so so then what happened ?
so did you two uh have uh
you know
no .
did he kiss you good night ?
what do you mean you do n't know ?
well what kind of a kiss ? was it a peck ? was it a kiss ? was it a long make out thing ?
so you like him .
ah i 'm jealous of everybody .
hello . oh hi . what 's happening ? what ? oh um sure um yeah okay uh . i 'll see you then . yeah yeah bye .
that was keith .
he wants me to help him move .
you know furniture .
i said yes but i do n't feel right about it . i mean i hardly know the guy . that 's a big step oin a relationship . the biggest . that 's like going all the way .
well we went out one time . do n't you think that 's coming on a little too strong ?
keith hernandez just asked me to help him move .
i said yes .
i 'm not driving him to the airport .
hey kramer do me a favour .
do n't mention it to anybody .
she likes him i mean she really likes him .
who would n't like him ? i like him . and i 'm a guy .
forget that . he 's a ball player . mvp NUM . i 'm making wise cracks in some night club . this guy was in game six . they 're a perfect match . they like go together . they 're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike .
you know i know this sounds a little arrogant but i never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me . ya know i guess i had my chance and that 's that .
really ?
i do n't know six three .
so i guess it 's fair to say you 've set different goals for yourself than say thomas edison magellan these types of people .
oh yeah . my favourite explorer . around the world . come on .
desoto ? what did he do ?
oh . like they would n't have found that anyway .
no i ca n't i 've got some stuff to do then i 've got to meet keith at my apartment at three . i 'm helping him move .
i know is n't that something ?
i do n't know he 's got some valuable antiques he 's worried they 'll break something .
i 'm not driving him to the airport .
is there a box spring ?
is there a box spring ?
is that a sectional ?

nice looking lugar .
what 's taking him so long out there ?
she 's a nazi george . a nazi .
well we got to make a plan before they come back what are we going to do ?
let 's just make a run for it .
how 'd that happen ?
i know why do they make that bed so tight ? you got to sleep with your feet like that .
i do n't know .
nah . no one 's ever been shot in the city .
i may not look like a murphy but i act like a murphy .
dublin . originally . parents came over here when i was eighteen . cereal famine . could n't get a bowl anywhere . bad . tis a beautiful country though lush rolling hills and the peat ah the peat .
we were right on the border .
get in the car . get in the car .
no he was talking to me he 's cross eyed .
it 's safer . plus it 's more annoying to the other person .
oh look at this guy .
oh there 's a guy trying to get in front of me he has to ask permission . yes . go ahead . get in get in .
no nothing . how could you not give a thank you wave ? hey buddy . where 's my thank you wave ?
give me that wave .
yeah i 'm free why ?
oh my god . you wo n't believe what i just saw . a car just bashed into a parked car and sped off right on my block .
what ?
elaine the guy could be dangerous .
i 'm not yella .
wait he stopped he 's parking .
uh excuse me uh i was uh driving behind you uh a few blocks back and i i could n't help uh maybe you did n't realize uh i witnessed that uh um you 're tire 's a little low . that can affect the performance of the twin high beam suspension not to mention your rack and pinion steering .
so i wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her .
you know i really liked her . we talked . we flirted . and when she left she reached out and touched my arm .
he he he .
let 's not even analyze it .
i wanted to but i could n't go through with it .
friday night .
yep .
come on up .
by the way elaine does not need to know about anything .
oh you dig ?
why ?
i wonder if i 'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all .
look she slammed into a parked car . she took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger then she sped off like a criminal .
on the other hand does that mean she should never be allowed to date again ? you scratch one car and you 're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life ? .
what am i drinking milk ?
hi .
thank you .
with that ?
what car ?
oh right right right right right right right the hit and run . well . actually the guy went into queens .
over the bridge .
yeah queens .
so he gets out of the car i say hey buddy . i saw you hit that car . so he says to me what are ya going to do about it ? '
so i said to him whatever 's necessary . '
what ?
oh it was nothing .
well he kinda lost his temper and he was pushing me up against the car . so i went into a karate stance .
i know a little .
he backed off . pretty pathetic actually .
ah nah .
australia ?
but not anymore .
oh friday i ca n't i 'm sorry i have a date .
we just met .
ask george to go with you .
why do you even need anybody ?
oh anthony quinn fine actor . but from what i understand not a very good driver . hits everything on the road . but always leaves a note .
excellent film . in fact quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car .
kirk douglas . now there 's another very bad driver . but he 's such an unbelievable guy that when he hits someone he does n't even leave a note . he sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license registration and apologize .
the question is did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his god bless you ? because as the husband he has the right to first refusal .
come on up .
no argument . unless she 's one of these multiple sneezers and he 's holding his god bless you in abeyance until she completes the series .
what if she 's having an off night ?
hi .
a stupid what ?
you know if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze you should n't say god bless you' you should say you 're soo good looking .
entertainment tonight 's on .
bedroom .
what 's it like out ?
can i take a sweater ?
scarf ?
what 's the matter ? what 's going on ?
what is wrong ? .
get together ?
yeah .
what car ?
yeah who ?
the blond with the blue sweatpants . yeah i think i 've seen her .
the blond with the blue sweatpants .
i 've had a crush on this woman for year . i 've always been afraid to approach her . she looks like she belongs on one of these hallmark cards .
oh yeah . too bad . angela . lousy thug . i mean what kind of sick person does something like that ? that woman belongs in prison . i mean i actually owe it to society to do something about this . i ca n't sit by and allow this to go on . it 's a moral issue is what it is .
how am i going to live with myself ? .
i 'm not religious but i certainly know where to draw the line .
do n't sell yourself short saying god bless you to every tom dick and harry in great personal risk .
there should be more people like us .
you 're telling me .
anyway i just wanted you to know that i 'm going to do everything i can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that .
thank you very much .
let me rephra
hi elaine this is angela .
well i think i get the gist of it .
what car ?
it 's not complicated .
alright elaine .
it was just a couple of blocks .
it 's not that hard .
hold it . hold it . hold it people . matador ? what matador ?
a matador . well well well . uno momento por favor . pray tell what was the young man 's name ?
eduardo carochio . that 's good . that 's very good . kind of just rolls of the tongue . i wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador ? perhaps zabars ? or les pizza .
anyway this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage .
$NUM ?
uh well i 'll tell you what . um i 'll give you a check and then this person can pay me back .
um who do i make it out to ?

i have to go meet nina . want to come up to her lot check out her paintings ?
there 's nothing to get .
she does a lot of abstract stuff . in fact she 's painting kramer right now .

is he okay ?
this is the most amazing story i 've ever heard why did he want you to take off the baseball cap ? that is so insane .
how you feeling ?
there 's george .
it 's preposterous . they ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game . how can you defend that ?
look i 'm really getting tired off all the fighting . maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other .
well i like to remain friends with people i was friends with .
that 's what she told me .
that 's what it costs .
i was n't thinking . i do n't know .
well she framed it and everything .
do you want me to paint you something ? i 'd love to paint you some thing .
wow a letter from nina .
oh my god .
this is amazing you ca n't believe this .
listen to this i do n't know what you expect to find out there jerry you know what you want better than me . but there 's one thing i do know . i know i can stand here watching you destroy everything i 've ever wanted in my life wanting to smash your face with my fists because you wo n't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that i love you . you mean so much to me that i 'm will ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity . '
cause that 's what you need to do to prove i 'm not going to leave you . i 'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships . you want me that fight for me becau '
no one 's ever written me a letter like this . maybe i was wrong about her .
should i ?
all right all right . i 'll call her .

wait a second wait a second . the letter that 's the letter .
this is the letter she wrote to me she stole it right from the movie .
cause you do n't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that i love you . '
i always thought there was something funny about this letter . she copied it right out of chapter NUM . she a thief a bunko artist .
what are you talking about ? she completely misrepresented herself . i do n't offer happiness . i offer happiness . james caan does n't offer happiness .
how 's it coming ?

no . i like a good comedy . you know like a neil simon ? you like neil simon ?
i 've seen most of it . i guess my favorite would have to be uh chapter NUM . have you ever seen that ?

c 'mon c 'mon
kramer . what are you doing ? .
get out . get out of the bathroom i got to go .
c 'mon .

is that my towel ?
hey did you ever pretend there 's like murderers chasing you and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment ?
oh . i see . there he is .
the murderers .
did you see the look on that guy 's face ?
kramer . what the hell are you doing here ? .
all right that 's it . hand em over .
what you know what the keys . i want the keys . you 've lost your key privileges .
no come on .
it was sold out .
that 's the point .
just look just give the keys .
do n't ask me .
i 'm telling you .
i 'm serious .
yes it will now give me those keys .
so put em in a safe place .
where ?
i think so . i mean he 's acting really weird lately he 's different .
i ca n't .
who 's there ?
elaine
take the keys .
ok .
your spare set ?
you want em back ?
did you bring the keys ?
this could be an emergency .
i tried to give em back he would n't take em .
they lost .
kramer ?
hello newman .
do n't play coy with me newman i 'm not in the mood .
is he being coy ?
you 're being coy . now where 's kramer newman ?
listen tiny . i want to know where kramer is and want to know now .
turn around george .
now you better tell me where kramer is or are we going to have to do this the hard way ?
where 's kramer ?
we 're trying to find out what happened to kramer .
bad rap ?
me ?
l . a . ?
i never should have taken his keys away . but he drove me to it . i had no choice . he would n't take em back . elaine you saw it remember ? i said take the keys back . he would n't do anything . you saw it did n't you see it ?
huh ?
no what 'd you say ?
oh you did n't see it .
i heard you say something there .
i 'm calling kramer 's mother . i do n't know what you said . but it was something . i heard something . hello ? hello mrs . kramer ? mrs . kramer ? could you turn the music down ? could you turn the music down .
she 's drunk out of her mind .
elaine ? are you there ? it 's me i 'm locked out of my apartment i need my spare keys . where are you ? i 'm at the coffee shop .
georgie boy . way to come through with the keys . sit down i 'm buying you dinner .
do n't feel right ? what are you talking about ?
what is the big deal ?
first of all you 're not even supposed to have elaine 's keys . you 're supposed to give em back to her so she can give em back to me because she has mine . so technically those are my keys .
well i want those keys .
george give them to me i want these keys . i do n't want to get physical .
do you want to fight ?
do n't you see ? you 're just avoiding the middle man . you were going to give her her spare keys so she was going to give em to me . so all that 's happening is that instead of giving them to her you 're giving them to me . it 's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours you did n't give her hers . cause then she would have given em to me because she has mine . so then i would have never had to ask you for hers so that i could get mine .
what 's that ?
i heard something .
well this is great .
they look like keys george . they look exactly like keys . what do they look like . '
well they 've got to be here somewhere .

elaine wait . i need my spare keys .
good .
and i do n't want you to hold mine .
good . do n't . are these my keys ?

elaine let me tell you something about show business . it 's hard work . you do n't just write a murphy brown . you got to watch the show study it get a sense of the characters how they relate to each other .
what did you say ?
i heard something . elaine elaine . it 's kramer . kramer 's on murphy brown' .
look there he is he 's sitting at the desk .

c 'mon will ya ?
something is n't it ?

how much did you wound up tipping her ?
well communism did n't work .
yeah there 's a new one in there .
help yourself .
kramer here .
what ?
everything with you comes down to toilet paper .
that 's always the first question with you . why is that always your focus ?
i do n't know . maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers .
maybe they should have a toilet paper museum . would you like that ? so we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages . toilet paper of the crusades the development of the perforation the first six pack . . .
hi .
sure .
hello .
george
oh thank you very much .
really ? wow .
i 'd be very interested in something like that .
okay . great . thanks .
thank you .
nice meeting you .
they said they were interested in me .
you know a tv show .
yeah i guess so .
well they want me to come up with an idea . i mean i do n't have any ideas .
why should i care if my son 's into gymnastics ?
but gymnastics is not for everybody .
so what ?
yeah and ?
what person who runs an antique store gets involved in people 's lives ?
so someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden i 'm getting them out of a jam ? i could see if i was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what 's wrong with everybody that comes in .
no they 're not they used to be .
oh like you do .
a circus ?
i do n't think so .
i do n't think the network will go for it .
look i 'm not pitching a show about freaks .
hello newman .
what 's this all about ?
i did n't know you had a motorctcle .
you have a girlfriend ?
i never remember you with a girl .
this is a pretty bad deal for kramer . you know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet . i think you 're cheating him .
all right .
you know you 're getting gypped over here .
gimme that just gimme that . here . idiots .
does that thing work ?
i just got a postcard from elaine ?
yeah they 're in london now . they 'll be back in a few weeks .
no nothing .
what do you need salsa for ?
you know why ? because people like to say salsa . excuse me do you have salsa ? we need more salsa . where is the salsa ? no salsa ? '
do n't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa ? you have the seltezer after the salsa . '
what ?
yeah right .
just talking ? well what 's the show about ?
no story ?
you 've got to have a story .
and who is on the show ? who are the characters ?
you ?
so on the show there 's a character named george costanza ?
and who else is on the show ?
now he 's a character . so everybody i know is a character on the show .
and it 's about nothing ?
so you 're saying i go in to nbc and tell them i got this idea for a show about nothing .
we ? since when are you a writer ?
you want to go with me to nbc ?
what do we got ?
what idea ?
i still do n't know what the idea is .
right .
so we go into nbc we tell them we 've got an idea for a show about nothing .
they say what 's your show about ? i say nothing . '
i think you may have something there .
so the show would be about my real life . and one of the characters would be based on you .
what do you mean you do n't think so ?
i do n't understand . what do n't you like about it ?
why not ?
you 're my neighbor . there 's got to be a character based on you .
i do n't understand what the big deal is .
whatever you want .
you ca n't play kramer .
but you ca n't act .
okay fine . we 'll use newman .
nothing what do you want ?
buyer beware .
karma kramer ?
salsa seltzer . hey excuse me you got any salsa ? no not selzer salsa . what 's the matter ?
you sure ? you look a little pale .
what are you nervous ?
what ?
this was your idea .
dont worry about it . they 're just tv executives .
i told you not to come .
they 'll give us water in there .
oh god it 's joe devola .
this guy 's a writer he 's a total nut . i think he goes to the same shrink as elaine .
oh god he saw me .
hey joe . how you doing ?
oh no just a custom . uh that 's my friend george . you look good .
oh no reason . you 're into karate right ?
what are you doing here ?
ah good for you .
well
no uh hey i guess i 'll see you sunday night .
kramer 's party .
no no he 's not having a party . he 's doing something . i do n't know what it is . it 's nothing . he 's not doing anything .
no i 'm sure you are . i 'm sure you are very close friends . very close .
give my best to hinckley .
i ca n't believe what i just did . i did n't know kramer did n't invite him . i better call kramer
relax . who are they ?
course not .
they 're nobody .
what about you ?
why not you ?
better .
no .
yeah it 's one of my favorites .
oh it was very funny . there was one great scene with the chef what was his name ?
oh pepe . yeah pepe . and uh he was making tamales .
well we 've thought about this in a variety of ways . but the basic idea is i will play myself
go ahead .
well it 's not about nothing .
well maybe in philosophy . but even nothing is something .
well as i was saying i would play myself and as a comedian living in new york i have a friend a neighbor and an ex girlfriend which is all true .
well i do n't know about the reading we did n't discuss the reading .
well uh maybe something happens on the way to work .
well something happens .
how about this i manage a circus
i do n't even want to talk about it anymore . what were you thinking ? what was going on in your mind ? artistic integrity ? where where did you come up with that ? you 're not artistic and you have no integrity . you know you really need some help . a regular psychiatrist could n't even help you . you need to go to like vienna or something . you know what i mean ? you need to get involved at the university level . like where freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you . that 's the kind of help you need . not the once a week for eighty bucks . no . you need a team . a team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you having conferences observing you like the way they did with the elephant man . that 's what i 'm talking about because that 's the only way you 're going to get better .
hold it . i really want to be clear about this . are you talking about the woman in the meeting ? is that the woman you 're talking about ?
it 's completely inappropriate .
oh i forgot to call kramer .
no no this is more important .
no i got to warn him that i told joe devola about his party .
well we were standing uh inn the waiting area there and you know how devola is . he 's all
and so uh i felt very uncomfortable with him and you know i just blurted out something about your party .
well i did n't know that you did n't invite him .
i just a ssumed
of course . how are you ?
tell me what ?
uh sorry excuse me one second . hello .
oh gee i ca n't talk right now . why do n't you give me your home number and i 'll call you later .
oh i guess you do n't want people calling you at home .
well now you know how i feel .
kramer are you drinking that milk ?
what 's the expiration date on that ?
the third ?
i think she saw it coming .
look just because kramer vomited on her does n't mean the deal is dead .
vommiting is not a deal breaker . if hitler had vommited on chamberlin chamberlind still would have given him chekoslovakia .
what happened to you ?
what ? devola ? see i told you this guy is crazy . i ca n't believe this . what happened ?
boy that is some kick .
wow newman 's helmet .
me why ?
what does he want from me ? i did n't do anything . see this is all elaine 's fault . she took off to europe with his psychiatrist . he probably ca n't get his medication . now i got some nut after me .
where the hell did i put this ?
the remote the remote i ca n't find the remote . did i lost i lost it . did you take it ? did you put it some place ?
all right what is this ?
all right very funny . i get it .
come on . go back to your apartment and fix it .
your pants .
do n't you know ? look look at your face . you only shaved the right side of your face . what is this ? a joke ?
go look at your face in the mirror .
yeah ?
come on up .
you mean you did n't know you were doing any of these things ?
i bet this is from that kick from that crazy joe davola . you better see a doctor and get some x rays .
from that woman at nbc ?
he drank it .
all right well we should all chip in i guess .
how much was it to clean the vest ?
can you get vomit out of suede ?
what ? yo yo ma ?
you just said yo yo ma .
he 's a cellist . you should see a doctor today .
i ca n't believe she sent you that dry cleaning bill .
that does n't really bode well for the show does it ?
oh yeah . right . like anybody 's ever going to do this . how did you get me to go along with that ? a show about nothing .
what are you doing ? what 's wrong with you ? what 're you doing ? give me that phone . go to your apartment and lie down i 'll make an appointment for a doctor today . hello ? oh hi . i 'm sorry . no that 's my next door neighbor . he 's not quite himself . he got kicked in the head . what ? really ? you 're kidding . today ? yeah . sure . we could make it . two o'clock ? yeah we would do that . okay . great . thanks a million . okay bye .
nbc . they want to have another meeting about the idea .
i do n't know about sixty .
ted danson . now how are you comparing us to ted danson ?
yes you did . you said we 're ted danson' .
you know i think he wears a piece .
i 'm ten minutes slow again . that 's it for this piece of junk . i 've had it .
yeah . but it never works . you know we 're supposed to be there by two o'clock . we should take a cab .
i 'll pay for it .
well what is it you object to ? the comfort ? the speed ? the convenience ?
uncle leo .
hello there how 're you doing ?
good good .
good fine .
oh no . i 've been kinda busy . it 's all .
oh sure . danny .
oh yeah yeah . i remember .
i i 'm sorry uncle leo i really got to get going .
we we got a big meeting with the president of nbc .
yeah i 'm really sorry uh .
i 'm sorry really .
sorry really .
you see the look on my uncle 's face ? did you see how insulted he was ? what could i do ? waht are we supposed to do ? you ca n't leave . there 's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives .
you could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire . you bump into one of my relatives . i 'm sorry uncle leo there 's a building full of people burning down . i really do have to be running . he 'll go go . go ahead . go to your fancy fire . if that 's what you have to do . '
why did n't you shave this morning ?
why ?
is that joe davola ?
i ca n't live tlike this . i 'm being stalked .
oh .
all right . look . now you promised you 're going to be a little more flexible on the nothing idea okay ? jsut a little .
would n't tune in .
no tune .
just a huge massive coronary .
he could n't believe it .
we would love to be in business . we 'll do business . we 're in business . it 's it 's business . this is business .

well what are we supposed to do ? i got to take kramer to the doctor .
good idea .
thanks .
he 's going to get a muffin and then he 'll walk us outside . this is a great way to go through life .
what are you doing ?
what are you ordering food now ?
what happened to the muffin ?
all of a sudden you get hungry ?
no . enjoy your lunch .
all of a sudden he gets hungry .
i know .
do you see him ?
well either you see him or you do n't .
what is he doing ? is he getting coffee ? i think he 's getting coffee . .
did you just order coffee ?
this is really too much .
well i 'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes . now you 're drinking coffee that 's going to be another ten minutes .
hey you guys .
what are you doing here ?
hey is davola outside ?
yeah .
eleven dollars for what ?
hey nbc okayed our idea . we 're going to make the pilot .
no .
hey newman is that your red car ?
i think you 're getting a ticket .
maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot .
oh like you know what you 're talking about .
so george and i went up to nbc and we told them the idea for a series now we 're just waiting to sign the contract .
yeah .
what writer ? it 's a sitcom .
soon there 's a couple of problems .
what do you expect ? it 's airline food .
how could you eat fish on a plane ?
well george does n't think $NUM NUM is enough money .
we 're going to sign it . we 're going to sign it . in fact george is out with the woman from nbc right now .
um i do n't even know ?
oh uh
that 's enough with this piece of junk i 've had it .
yeah but it never works .

it 's at the jeweler .
i 'm not sending you the bill .
what are you talking about ? it 's my car . let me pay for the gas .
dad .
i have money . i make money .
you do n't think i make money . that 's what you think is n't it ?
yes you do . that 's what you both think .
dad i 'm paying .
you 're not paying .
no do n't do this . you 're not doing this . i will fight you . no you do n't no .
boy you got a lot of stuff here . . . . dad what are you doing ?
leave it . what about your back ?
you come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you 're lifting heavy suit cases .
why did you tell this crazy guy that kramer did n't invite him to his party ?
i did n't know he was n't invited .
it was a mistake .
he 's got like a chemical imbalance . he needs to be on medication .
kramer .
he 's joking .
nooo .
he 's not after me .
who you going to to call ?
i did n't do anything .
no he just does n't like me .
you know it seems impossible .
ma i know this may be hard for you to understand but i am sure there are many people who do not like me .
it 's true .
um i have n't got my watch on . it 's being fixed .
uh next week .
huh ?
i do n't know . they 're backed up .
where 'd i take it ?
where did i take it ? where did i take it ? umm to that place on uh columbus and NUM . okay ?
yeah .
no kramer i do n't want you to say anything to him .
i 'd like to follow the regular procedures . i do n't want any special treatment .
be right back .
there 's no watch i threw it in the garbage can on the street . it did n't keep good time . my parents gave it to me but i did n't like it . so do n't mention it again okay .
all right .
you what ? you passed ? how could you do that ?
let me explain to you what you just did . there are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year . they go with maybe five . okay if we pass that 's it . they go to the next show .
we 're lucky they 're even interested in the idea in the first place . we got a show about nothing . with no story . what do you think they 're up there going hey maybe we should give those two guys who have no experience and no idea more money . ?
well i think you 're wrong .
yes we will .
i just said that .
so good for you .
what are you repeating everything i 'm saying ?
well george is an idiot .
no i do n't want ? em .
yeah ?
federal express ? come on up . . . . federal express . i 'm not expecting a package .
you think so ?
so you want to just abolish all home package deliveries .
who is it ?
i missed you .
yeah . . . seriously .
yeah big missing going on
oh it 's my parents . my father came up to see a back specialist .
yeah .
so tell us about the trip . how 's dr . reston ?
things are good ?
uh oh .
did you see that ?
it 's a tell . you got to tell .
when you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face you know it 's not going too well . go ahead ask me how it 's going with somebody .
good going good and the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting . you know it is like pretty good not bad i got to get out .
what are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers ? this is a sickening display .
you 're off bread . so what happened is it over ?
why not ?
svengali .
svenjolly .
george ?
well maybe he 's got like a cheerful mental hold on you .
nice try .
so you did n't even let the doctor treat you ?
hi uncle leo .
hey where 's the waiter . dad what say we have some red meat tonight . let 's live a little . .
could we continue this another time .
oh you know these jewellers they 're enigmas . they 're mysteries wrapped in a riddle .
she 's okay .
she 's nice .
she 's all right .
she 's not beautiful .
so you ask her out .
why not ?
she 's pretty . she 's not beautiful .
i think that 's a little extreme .
ah very good .
no thanks just the check .
what ?
come on .
what am i going to say ?
well you made me uncomfortable .
in the back on your right .
dad .
will you let me pay just once .
how you going to pay ? you do n't even have a wallet .
what 're you going to do ?
alright fine . you figure something out . i 'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money . cause if this works the whole monetary system 's obsolete we 're back to wampum . i 'm going to the bathroom .
uh yeah . hey uncle leo i hope i was n't uh rude to you that day i bumped into you on the street . uh i really did have to get to a meeting .
so you found that watch in the garbage can huh ?
oh heh . you know a friend of mine has a watch just like that . i 'd love to replace it for him as a gift .
yeah i know . maybe uh you want to sell me that one .
hang on a second . i got a little proposition for you .
alright two hundred but that 's as high as i can go . i really think you 're being unreasonable here .
look i happen to know how much that watch cost . it 's a sixty dollar watch you paid forty to get it fixed . that 's a hundred dollars . i 'm offering you two hundred .
aww right . three hundred plus fifty for the repair . three fifty that 's it .
yeah i think i do .
this is unbelievable .
i ca n't believe i 'm doing this . i never do stuff like this .
oh . really ? you do n't seem that desperate .
uh huh . well uh i 'll give you a call and thanks for the fish . by the way you know why fish are so thin ?
they eat fish .
how come the psychiatrist every the hour is only fifty minutes ? wha what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left ? do they just sit there going boy that guy was crazy . i could n't believe the things he was saying . what a nut . who 's coming in next ? oh no another headcase . '
i know i know .
i was always late . it was frustrating me . i 'm sorry i really am .
i woulda taken you to the airport .
neither do i . yeah ?
come on up . it 's george .
ah george turned it down .
yeah .
because of ted danson .
hey who knows maybe we 'll wind up getting more money .
what about nbc ? did you hear anything ?
hey . that 's wonderful . we got a deal .
heyy . terrific .
aww
c 'mon .
so what 'd we get ?
beautiful .
lemme see if i understand this . in other words you held out
you know the basic idea of negotiation as i understand it is to get your price to go up .
you know this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world .
yeah ?
alright we 're coming down .
dad before we go i got a little something for you .
a present .
c 'mon you lost your wallet i figured i 'd get you another one .
ah hah alright let 's go .
okay .
yeah i 'm good for about four thousand dollars .
hey uncle leo .
how you doing ?
this is some beautiful parking spot you got here .
yeah . hey dad you sure you do n't need any more money ?
alright i 'm just joking . listen have a nice trip .
take care now . so long .
oh he took it . i put four hundred dollars in the new wallet .
he lost all that cash . it was the only way i could give it back to him otherwise he would n't accept it .
main difference between the women 's wallet and the man 's wallet is the photo section . true ? women carry with them a photograph of every person they 've ever met every day in their whole lives since the beginning of time . and every picture is out of date . you know what i mean ? it 's here 's my cousin three years old . she 's in the marines now . this is my dog . he died during the johnson administration . you know . you get stopped by a cop no licence no registration here 's fifty six people that know me . cop goes . alright ma'am just wanted to make sure you had some friends move it along . routine pal check . '
have you ever called someone up and you 're disappointed when they answer the phone ? you wanted the machine . you know and you 're always kind of thrown off you go oh i eh i i did n't know you were there i ah just wanted to leave a message saying sorry i missed you . '
well this is it .
oh you 're welcome . you know i think i ate too much of that garlic .
no i ate the whole plate . i did n't know those little things were garlic . i thought they were peanuts .
no i mean i do n't think so .
no no no . i 'm not happy i 'm not lucky and i do n't go . if anything i 'm sad stop unlucky .
that 's not funny naomi .
i did n't mean to be funny there . why do n't you check the tv guide . i think uh holocaust is on .
this thing has never worked right .
well first of all elmer fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time . i 'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit hahahahahaaa come on . not only that a juicer is one of the healthiest ways it makes the juice it extracts the the pulp and and and the vitamins for for long life and and and vitality .
how could you leave a message like that on my machine . ?
because i did n't think anyone would leave it .
well now she 's not going away for this weekend .
nah it 's better anyway . i mean really . what was going to happen ? i 'm a comedian . how can i go out with a girl with a laugh like that ? i mean izz it 's like ah it 's like coco chanel going out with a fish monger . you know cause she 's with all the perfumes and a fish monger 's pretty bad smell .
yeah but if i ask elaine then kramer will feel slighted .
yeah wait a minute do you smell smoke ?
ah kramer .

you got four hours . what about the script ?
right after we get off the phone then you go and tell her that ? . well of course she knows it was me who complained . now i 'm responsible for this woman 's quitting . oh this is unbelievable .
ohh dial the number . how could you do this ?
oh just trying to help me hello ? sandra ? hi uh this is jerry seinfeld . listen i i just want to tell you there 's been a terrible misunderstanding see i told elaine that uh it was a real treat talking to you on the phone and she thought i was being sarcastic you know cause i 'm a comedian and all . she thought i meant yeah it was a real treat talking to her on the phone . you know but i was really being sincere no of course i like you tonight ? um uh hold on a second . now she wants to have a drink with me . yeah i think i can um yeah i know where that is ok uh i 'll see you there . okay bye . now i got to have a drink with her .
what ? .
what ? what ? . you were the one who was talking dirty . i was just trying to keep up .
why ? it did n't mean anything . i was just trying to join in so you would n't feel embarrassed .
i 'm not sick . you you said much sicker things than me .
i really think you 're making too much of this .
let me walk you to a cab .
i mean the main thing is that this is just between us and that 'll be the end of it .
i mean people they 're not interested in things like this . they do n't want to hear about it . they really do n't .
so we 're uhh drinking and talkin' and uhh so she starts rubbing my leg .
have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg ?
i mean i know it 's the wrong thing to do . she works in elaine 's office . i know it 's wrong but i ca n't get that hand off my leg . i mean i 'm looking at the hand and i 'm thinking that hand should not be on my leg . but i ca n't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words would you mind ? . '
i do n't know they 're working on a whole other level
so we go back to my apartment
so we 're uh fooling around there you know it 's getting a little passionate and uh she starts with the dirty talking .
oh you know the usual
typical things .
she says uh
and then she starts talking about her panties .
so i said something .
now bear in mind i am just trying to keep up .
okay ? so she 's taking about her panties so uh so i said you mean the panties your mother laid out for you ? '
i do n't know . it just popped out .
she flipped out . just left .
look the main thing is i do n't want elaine to know about any of this . i mean especially the panty remark . i mean it 's embarrassing . and she 's never let me hear the end of it .
she will tell her . she 's going back to work . i talked her into it how stupid was that ? hey so susan 's father took that news pretty hard huh ?

ooo that was a bad toast .
i never heard anybody curse in a toast .
there were old people there all the relatives . you were like a red fox record . i mean at the end of the toast nobody even drank . they were just standing there they were just frozen . that might have been one of the worst all time toasts .
what do you mean not going ? why not ?
why does n't she pay for hers ?
it 's nice to get a reach .
who is it ?
because of divola . get in here how come you 're not dressed ?
you 're going like this ?
i thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera .
well what about me . if you 're going like that i ? m not going like this .
why should i be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours ?
all right all right i ? ll wear this . it 's bad enough i ? ve got to go to the opera i ? ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here .
would you turn that down . what is that crap .

what do you think i care about the money ? is that what you think ? you want me to show you what i care about money ? here look here look at this here 's a dollar here look there that ? s how much i care about money .

i never told you his name .
joe divola .
how do you know his name ?
oh my god its joe divola
that madman is trying to kill me .
oh . he said that . can you imagine what he 'll do if he sees me with you . he 'll think i ? m the one who ruined his deal at nbc and took away his girl he 'll put a kibosh on me .
aaahhhhh .
i do n't have anything i gave it to that guy .
i 'm telling you the guy took
that is one angry clown .
the hardest part about being a clown it seems to me would be that you 're constantly referred to as a clown . who was that clown ? ' i 'm not working with that clown did you hire that clown ? ' the guy 's a clown . . how do you even start into being a clown how do you know that you want to be a clown i guess you get to a point where you 're pants look so bad it 's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done . because if you think about it a clown if there is n't a circus around them is really just a very annoying person . you 're in the back seat of this guys volkswagen what you 're picking somebody else up ? oh man . '
camera curtains lights this is it we 'll hit the heights oh what heights we 'll hit on with the show this is it .
oh there 's that clown again what does he want from me . look i ? m serious i ? m not kidding i do n't have the quarter that guy took it .
binaca ?
come on you got to let us in
we have tickets we just do n't have em with us .
you do n't understand someone 's after us a crazy clown is trying to kill us .
we thought he was with you .

yeah .
susan . what are you doing here ?
where 's george ?
uncomfortable ? how does you think i feel ? hey let me ask you something how much did you pay for that ticket ?
kramer who 'd you sell your ticket to ?
i had some friends drag me to an opera recently you know how they 've got those little opera glasses you know do you really need binoculars i mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot em . these opera kids they 're going two fifty two eighty three twenty five they 're wearing big white woolly vests the women have like the breastplates the bullet hats with the horn coming out . if you ca n't pick these people out forget opera think about optometry maybe that ? s more you 're thing .
we 're dead .
we are dead .
all day tomorrow ? we had a month and a half to come up with something and we did n't do anything .
let me ask you something . when 's the last time you went skiing ?
i think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now .
so what ? you ca n't meet anybody . you 're going on with susan .
hey see those two women over there ? i almost dated the one on the right . she 's in the closet business .
what is it your business ?
she reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space . she looked into my closet .
yeah .
so she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me . what do i need more closet space for ? hi marla .
george marla .
stacey .
george stacey .
george .
trip to berlin ?
oh right right .
yes yes i did . but you know i was watching it on cnn and they covered it so well i thought why knock my brains out ? '
really ?
oh did he like it ?
so are you going to go out with her ?
what about susan ?
depends .
on many factors .
well how long you 've been seeing her . what 's your phone call frequency ? are you on a daily ?
what about saturday nights ? do you have to ask her out or is a date implied ?
she got anything in your medicine cabinet ?
ah hah . let me ask you this . is there any tampax in your house ?
well i 'll tell you what you 've got here .
you got yourself a girlfriend .
i 'm looking at a guy in a semi daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on saturday night . i would like to help you out but
you 're going to make a good father someday .
fine . break up with her . but you know what this means ?
the script the pilot the tv show . that 's all over .
figure it out . she 's one of the executives at nbc that 's going to make the decision whether or not they pick up the show . she 's one of our biggest fans . you drop her off you think they 're going to pick us up ?
you know it 's a very interesting situation . here you have a job that can get you girls . but you also have a relationship . but if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls you lose the job . you see the irony ?
oh yeah .
this is your plan ?
i do n't think you are .
please and be brutal . i have no closet sensitivity .
i do n't think i am .
try me .
everything ?
you 're quite mad you know . oh i do n't believe this . hey ?
what are you doing ?
no .
this is not a good time .
what did you have to give your tv away to george for ?
yeah but now you 're in here all the time .
marla kramer .
why do n't you go out ? it 's nice out .
there 's weather .
i 'm telling george to give you your tv back .
i do n't know .
kramer
so your boyfriend never came back from berlin .
oh you must have been devastated being left for a wall .
ah hah . excuse me one second . yeah ?
come on up . oh it 's elaine she 's just a friend of mine . i do n't know what she 's doing here now . i 'm sorry . what ?
ugh . so you were saying there was this problem .
snapple ?
go on .
yes .
yeah .
hi um . marla elaine .
oh thanks a lot two weeks late . now that costs me thirty five dollars to see havana .
i like that thing in your hair there .
so we 'll talk about the hooks then ?
she 's a virgin she just told me .
well it 's not like spotting a toupee .
no no i mean
elaine elaine yeah ?
a virgin .
i do n't know . i 'm very attracted to her . that accent it 's so sexy .
you need a little pioneer spirit . you know you do n't have any of that lewis and clark in you .
yeah me too .
all right but then we got to get some work done . let me just call kramer see if want anything . hey we ordering chinese food . if you want anything let me know what it is and i 'll order for you .
all right let 's go . we do n't have much time before the meeting .
do n't worry he 'll be here . look we only got about two hours . we just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting . there 's your food .
yeah .
your butler ?
what about me ?
that 's the stupidest idea i ever heard . sentenced to be a butler . ping what happened ?
what happened ?
should i call an ambulance ? do you want to see a doctor ?
yeah here .
you 're giving him back that tv .
a month and a half we had . we did nothing . i ca n't believe we put it off until today and then we could n't do anything because elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin crosses against a light and knocks over a chinese delivery boy . now we 're going to make fools of ourselves we got nothing . you 're not even in show business . i got to reputation . you drag me into the sewer with you . i 've been on tv buddy boy . you know how fast word spreads in show business ? it 's like that like that . one bad impression you 're outta the business .
what do you mean ? they know we 're here .
no no would you get up ?
no .
what ?
yes i was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star .
hi how are you doing ? nice to see you all here . hello .
oh uh nice to meet you . where 's russell ?
oh poor blossom .
oh he ran to say something to david letterman .
yeah he just walked by .
yeah good idea .
good good we 've got a lot of ideas .
have you ever been to a chinese restaurant and they tell you it 'll be like five minutes for a table and you wind up waiting there for like thirty minutes ? well we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you 're doing is waiting for the table . because we 've all been in that situation . you know you 're waiting and you 're hungry and you bump into somebody you know when is russell coming back ?
well no that 's one . we have many others . we have an idea where uh i get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler . you know he cooks for me he has to cook for me he cleans my house he 's doing my shopping you know ? i 'm walking around with one of those big neck collars .
do n't worry uh we 'll find something for you .
so letterman did n't spark to your idea huh ?
would you give him the tv back ?
why did he fire her ?
you ca n't break up with her now . her life is shattered . you got her fired . you got to be there for her .
you got to at least wait until she gets another job .
couple of interviews .
what ? leave ? where ? why ?
why would i leave ? this is my apartment .
who gave you this idea i would want to leave ?
listen i would n't put too much stock into what elaine has to say about relationships . she comes from a broken home and i mean that literally . a tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure . her parents got along beautifully but her house was in bad shape .
what else did you say to her ?
more like a dope was giving it to her straight . another cup of coffee with you she 'll wind up in a convent .
what is that about leaving after sex ? did i ever leave with you ?
i was trying to be .
oh you 're not kidding . who 'd ve figured susan would break up with him ? they had a good thing going .
let me ask you a question .
you 're a hostage captured by terrorists
you anybody whatever . you 're in the little room you 're chained to the floor you 're there for a long time do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry ?
what 's the matter ?
caught you ? doing what ?
where ?
glamour ?
so what did she do ?
what did you do ?
no i would n't think so .
glamour ?
ohhh yeah right .
no chance .
well i know i could hold out longer than you .
sure how much ?
you 're on .
you ?
you 'll be out before we get the check .
ohh no . no no no
it 's apples and oranges
because you 're a woman .
it 's easier for a woman not to do it than a man .
we have to do it . it 's part of our lifestyle . it 's like uh shaving .
okay one fifty .
well obviously we all know each other very well i 'm sure that we 'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system .
yeah ?
how is she ?
yeah ?
come on up .
dating marla .
yeah .
well i got my troops amassed along the border i 'm just waiting for someone to give me the go ahead .

what about the chamber maids ? are they naked too ?
not me .
there 's a naked woman across the street .
yeah the the waitress shouldo ve taken it back .
uh huh .
well it was that woman across the street . you know you better be careful buddy . she 's going to get you next .
slow it down ?
ah yeah i know .
yeah yeah of course . what do you think i care about the sex ? what kind of person do you think i am ? that does n't mean anything to me . i do n't care about that .
sure saturday night .

yeah good morning .
she 's not there . she 's doing her wash .

come on up .
there may have been some incidental penetration . but from her angle she was in no position to make the call .
is that so unforgivable ? is that like breaking a commandment ? did god say to moses thou shalt not pick ?
let me ask you something . if you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would would you do ? would you continue going out with her ?
yeah . i think i do .
i ca n't she wo n't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light .
but that 's not what she thinks .
all right . i 'll call the agency . hello . yes i 'm trying to get in touch with tia van camp . do you know if she 's been in town ? she 's been in town . oh really . well thank you very much . she has been in town . she 's at calvin klein 's right now .
hello there you are .
well i had to talk to you i noticed you have n't been returning my calls .
because i i thought we had a good time the other night ang the only explanation i can come up with is that you think that you caught me
but i was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril .
but there but there was no pick . i i did not pick . there ws no piick .
no . no pick .
ang what if i did do it ? even though i admit to nothing and never will . what does that make me ? and i 'm not here just defending myself but all those pickers out there who 've been caught . each ang every one of them who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you are we not human ? . if we pick do we not bleed ? . i am not an animal .
the pick ?
i think i 've seen that look .

hello . welcome back .
well birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we 've grown . no matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge with each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it 's not to be that for the rest of our sad wretched pathetic lives this is who we are to the bitter end . inevitably irrevocably happy birthday ? no such thing .
well thank you very much it 's about time .
drop the case ? well congratulations that 'll save you some money .

i will babu . i will help you babu do n't worry .
uh oh .
well this is interesting .
it 's a letter from the immigration bureau it 's babu 's visa renewal application form . they must have put it in my mailbox by mistake .
if you had given me my mail last week when i got home this whole thing never would have happened .
yeah so am i being funny now ?
see i told you i was n't funny all the time . hey george look i 'm not funny now .
oh look i need to get in touch with cheryl . babu needs a lawyer his visa 's expired .

ah will you stop it already ?
how long is this going to go on ?
well when is that going to be ?
consummation ? i do n't think you have enough material .
that 's wonderful news . thank you .
well with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy it does n't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful .
i do n't care .
not really . sometimes when i 'm in the tub .
i 'm a comedian . oh let me get that . you 've been so helpful .
yeah i 'll just pay for this .
babu .
you remember elaine .
oh babu .
we do what we can .
yes well see here 's the thing babu . um what happened was i was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows .
well elaine here was picking up my mail while i was away because you know that little box can get very full .
oh i do n't want to bother you .
so yesterday after they took you away i looked in my mail and i noticed that the mailman accidentally put your visa renewal in my mail box .
you see i 've been home for a week and elaine did n't give me my mail until yesterday even though i asked her repeatedly for it .
well not technically .
well what about her ?
babu ? .
babu i 'm going to fix everything . i have a lawyer who knows someone in the immigration department they 're going to straighten the whole thing out the wheels are in motion things are happening even as we speak .
the wheels are in motion things are happening .
i do n't know i do n't understand it . cheryl was supposed to take care
c 'mon up .
babu must be back .
where 's babu ?
who are you ?
i 'm sure the lawyer did everything they could .
hey what happened ? i thought cheryl was going to help babu get his visa .
no .
he 's in pakistan .
what do you mean oh boy ?
told her the truth ? well you got babu deported .
that 's because she had my mail .
how could you go in there ?
well what happened ?
that 's funny that 's funny . i 'm sick of cleaning . that 's very funny .
yeah it 's funny .
it 's funny .
it cannot not be funny . now come on let 's stay with it we got to finish this today .
yeah maybe i 'll give it to elaine .
right right . okay . elaine enters .
what does she say ?
i do n't know .
you know if we bring elaine in it 's going to be so many people to keep track of . it 's going to be too hard i 'll forget where everybody 's standing you me kramer the butler it 's too much .
alright .
hey .
who ?
did you talk to her ?
so what happened ?
yeah i know about the three dates .
what do you mean you snubbed her ?
right by her ?
what you do say about a guy like this huh . you are some great friend i tell ya snubbed her . not that i condone it . i 've never condoned snubbing in my administration . but your loyalty is beyond question .
yeah i know .
well there were too many people in the room we could n't keep track of everybody . george and the butler and
well we tried . we could n't . we did n't know how to uh we could n't write for a woman . we did n't know what you would say . even right now i 'm sitting here i know you 're going to say something i have no idea what it is .
something derogatory ?
well gail cunningham .
why ?
are you sure ?
nothing . hey where you going with that ? gimme that .
i took two bites how am i finished ? plus you 're coming down with something ? you want me to get sick ? bite ?
i do n't know . once he leaves the building he 's out of my jurisdiction .
alright . so where ya cooking now ?
ah the power lunch crowd .
would you care to join us ?
see ya .
that bothered you ?
it did ?
no . this is why you 're not in the pilot .
i thought your mother 's paying for it .
you know he 's right . it 's not her place to criticize the script which reminds me what did you think of it ? you never told me .
hey one second you do n't get off that easy . c 'mon tell me what you thought .
you what ?
you kissed her ?
what kinda great friend are you ? how do you go from snubbing to kissing ?
and what did she do ?
i do n't get this . i go out with this girl three times she does n't want to shake my hand why 's she kissing you ?
so what ?
are you alright ?
oh where did you eat ?
ah . i know the chef there .
oh you have a daughter ?
what ?
what ?
i 'm not sure . what was that dish he said he had ?
ah . you know primavera is italian for spring . '
yeah .
another ending ?
maybe we should go .
i ca n't listen to anymore of this the guy 's losing a lung in there .
hi .
oh i 'm jerry .
we 're here discussing our script with your father .
uh huh .
what were you doing ?
you 're supposed to just take a peek after a poke . you were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the empire state building .
looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun you do n't stare at it . it 's too risky . you get a sense of it and then you look away .
that 's why i poked .
what ?
she did ?
is that what she said ?
she is ?
hello ? oh hi stu .
yeah . what 's going on ? what ? really ? oh my god did he give you a reason ? oh boy . okay . alright . thanks . dalrymple just cancelled the pilot .
if you had n't gone into her restaurant this never would have happened .
there was cleavage in the area . that 's a reflex cleavage poke cleavage poke
you do n't consider age in the face of cleavage . this occurs on a molecular level you ca n't control it . we 're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head .
you know what we could do ? he eats at that restaurant pfeiffer 's ? we could have gail call us tell us the next time he 's there go there and talk to him .
the whole thing is so stupid . like he would n't do the same thing if elaine walked by in a low cut dress .
no .
ya .
kramer listen i want you to ask gail to do me a favor . the next time russell dalrymple comes in the restaurant ask her if she would call me .
ok .
look sweetheart you know you 've got it all . but let 's face it
beautiful .
no come on . i 'll buy you another pair .
i 'll get you another one just like it .
hey . whattaya know .
fancy meeting you here .
you know it 's a funny thing because after the pilot got cancelled we had n't heard from you .
did n't know we were wondering what happened .
no leer .
really good .
very tasty .
the pilot 's back on . in fact elaine 's going out with him tomorrow night . listen elaine you know if russell mentions anything about the pilot you 'll of course tell him how much you liked it ?
uh that kind of comedy that 's a little broad for us .
it 's funny .
funny is funny we 're here to entertain right ?
if you can .
i think what he 's trying to say is get the bouilla base .
unbelievable . she 's not there .
the works for the nyu school newspaper . she 's a grad student in journalism . never been to a comedy club . never even seen me has no idea who i am .
y'know you 've been developing quite the acid tongue lately
living or all time ?
well if it 's all time then there 's no contest . it begins and ends with brezhnev .
what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm not going along . i can just see you in berlin in NUM goose stepping past me c 'mon jerry go along go along
y'know i hear that all the time .
that i 'm gay . people think i 'm gay .
yeah cuz i 'm single i 'm thin and i 'm neat .
oh yeah what ? buck naked ?
you told me that already like two months ago .
how you going to get out of that one ?
he 's going to hang around if that 's alright with you ?
yeah i washed it .
so wash it .
i did n't say i did n't like it . i said it was o . k
oh so what if i do n't like it . is that like the end of the world or something ?
actually we met in the gym locker room .
live together ?
know what ?
oh god you 're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us . i knew you looked familiar .
there 's been a big misunderstanding here . we did that whole thing for your benefit . we knew you were eavesdropping . that 's why my friend said all that . it was on purpose . we 're not gay . not that there 's anything wrong with that
i mean that 's fine if that 's who you are
i mean i have many gay friends
it was a joke
no steam .
today 's not my birthday .
look at this . a phone . a two line phone .
hey where you going ?
thank you very much that 's great click oh . hold on a sec i got a call on the other line . click click hello ?
hey how ya doin ? y'know i got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line .
she says she 's not going to play up that angle of the story . she thinks we 're heterosexual . i guess we fooled her . i 'll get rid of her hold on click click sharon ? hello ? sharon are you there ? click click i 'm back
what are you talking about ?
you heard me talking on the other line are you sure ?
well maybe she was disconnected .
alright hang on . let me call kramer and see if you can hear anything hold on . click click click
kramer there may be a problem with the phone hold on . click click
oh no . click click kramer this phone 's a piece of junk goodbye .
oh no . now she 's heard everything . what are we going to do ? . ?
no no of course not . people 's personal sexual preferences are nobody 's business but their own .
she would n't take her coat off at my house either .
so you do n't take your coat off and now everyone at nyu thinks i 'm gay . not that there 's anything wrong with that
guys and dolls ? is n't that a lavish broadway musical ?
the collected works of bette midler .
what do you got there ?
although they maintain separate residences the comedian and his long time companion seem to be inseparable oh no . the associated press picked up the nyu story . that 's going to be in every paper . i 've been outedo . i was n't even in' .
not that there 's anything wrong with that
within the confines of his fastidious bachelor pad seinfeld and costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of fruit like an old married couple i told you that pear was washed .
here we go
it 's not true .
so are you

what . ?
i know . what are you doing here ? . ?
would you get the hell out of here .

well you 've only got another fifty years or so to go before it 'll all be over
yeah how about a mute ?
ah where you going to meet a mute ?
a deep yawning chasm
listening to you . i listen to this for fifteen minutes and i 'm on top of the world . your misery is my pleasure .

whattya mean ?
he fired you ? . ?
well i dunno about you two but i 'm quitting . i hate my guy . he 's a mean mean guy .
so quit .
what happened ?
oh yeah you and your sergio mendes
well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy i was visiting today was throwing away sinatra duke ellington al jolson benny goodman
yeah and then i asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah .
but you 're going to have to go get em . i 'm not carrying them all .
yeah i 'm going there today . in fact you should see this house keeper he 's got . she 's from senegal wild wild stuff

well after he bit my friend
i i 'm sorry .
well i brought them up there to take his records
there you are . did you find him ?
hi sidra . i usually last about ten minutes on a stairmaster . unless of course there 's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard then i can go an hour .
oh yeah . that 's why they call it a stairmaster . you get up there and you stare .
alright i 'll see you thursday night right ?
alright .
tremendous workout .
tremendous girl .
yeah . i really like her .
what ? do n't say that .
how do you know ?
i 'm not bragging i happen to have a very keen lesbian eye . hi how ya doin .
yes they do .
a leg man ? why would i be a leg man ? i do n't need legs . i have legs . have you ever seen her naked in the locker room ?
oh well then i ca n't accept your testimony . maybe if you had seen her naked .
well i do .
look you made the allegation . the least you could do is follow up .
yes . go in there . do a little investigative journalism . i need to know .
do n't be so sure . look at george he 's on his ninth date with betsy he still has n't gotten anywhere with her .
well every time he tries to make a move something screws up . like on their last date they were on the couch but she was sitting on his wrong side .
yeah she was on his right side . he ca n't make a move with his left hand . ca n't go left .
no . i 'm lefty ca n't go right . what about women ? do they go left or right ?
you 're sure ?
well then that 's it . that 's the end of that .
just cause of that ? it 's like finding out mickey mantle corked his bat .
you do n't touch the nose . you do n't aspire to reach the nose . you do n't unhook anything to get to a nose and no man has ever tried to look up a woman 's nostril .
well i take it very seriously .
hey . you know i do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like .
you ? how do you know ?
real busy now down at the office ?
you put her on a pedestal .
he puts em on a dental chair .
yeah funny . yeah i never heard that before . so you going to the funeral ?
what are you kidding ? it 's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship . she 's crying you put your arm around her and console her you 're the consolation guy .
her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you .
this confers upon you instant boyfriend status . the family 's there you 're taking care of things you 're getting the sandwiches you 're the rock .
you fell on her ?
you what ?
you touched em ? .
wow .
excuse me ? .
oh what do you know you have no breast touching experience .
so have i .
anyway touching two breasts does n't make you an expert .
aw what are you doing to me ?
i do n't know one minute you say they 're fake the next minute you think they 're real i do n't know what to believe .
but you were just grabbing on to them to save your life . if you were drowning and i threw you a life preserver you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable ?
well i do n't mind someone with a phony personality but i got to draw the line somewhere .
hey . george off to detroit ?
there 's sidra .
where ?
talking to sidra ?
i do n't think that 's salman .
if that 's rushdie they 're real .
well i got to know i 'm talking to sidra .
oh how can you be so sure ?
look you idiot first of all it 's salman not salmon .
alright maybe it is but listen i got to get ready sidra 's coming over in a few minutes so if you do n't mind
i 'm going to find out tonight .
hey would you mind switching seats ?
oh i do n't know i just like sitting to the left of people makes me feel like i 'm driving .

it it rhymes with a female body part .
mulva
aub ah gipple ?
loleola ?
oh . oh . delores .
ages zero through ten candy is your life . there 's nothing else . family friends school they 're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy . and you have your favorite candies that you love . you know the ones i love those i hate those . ``i hate those i love those . and only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red m&m and a light brown m&m . that 's two totally different things when you 're seven years old . well your red is more of a main course m&m but the brown it 's more of a mellower flavor it 's an after dinner m&m really' .
and it is embarrassing because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you are n't hungry or you 've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is . how about the doggie bag on a date ? that 's a good move for a guy huh ? lemme tell you something if you 're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too . you 're not going to be needing those for awhile either .
is that bothering you ?
please hurry . look at you . look at what you 've become .
oh carl ca n't wait a few more minutes ?
he 'll like you more
yeah i 'm wanting to get married real soon
so where am i dropping you ?
this guy 's got quite a racket . i take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment
so is tonight the night ?
oooh . bay bee doll .
boy do you smell something ?
what is it ?
what ?
it ca n't be . nobody has b . o . like this .
but the whole car smells .
so when somebody has b . o . the o usually stays with the b . once the b leaves the o goes with it .
so this morning i go down to the garage to check the car out . i figure by this time the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de smellify . i open the car door like a punch in the face the stench hits me it 's almost as if it had gained strength throughout the night
what about skunk ?
horse manure ?
well i 've never seen anything like this in my life . in fact i went to the car wash they want NUM dollars to detail it and get the smell out . i 'm not paying for that . that 's not my responsibility . in fact i 'm driving up to that restaurant now and demand they pay for it .
it means he 's lying .
why ? is that what he told you ?
no . never .
well sometimes we do actually have to get up early but a man will always trade sleep for sex .
anything 's possible
what 's the matter with you ?
oh yeah steinbrenner
i know the list
what smell ?
whatdo ya mean i stink ?
i showered . oh wait a second since i showered i 've been in the car .
do n't you see what 's happening here ? it 's attached itself to me . it 's alive .
what happened ? my car stinks is what happened . and it 's destroying the lives of everyone in it 's path .
yeah .
i know i was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his NUM years in the business he 's never smelled anything like it .
no no . it 's the valet guy .
oh no that 's ridiculous .
suicide maybe not lesbianism .
there should be a b . o . squad that patrols the city like a smell gestapo . to sniff em out strip em down and wash them with a big soapy brush
lemme see if i understand this on second thought
here he is that 's the guy . no thank you go back go back i 'll park it . you go back .
i mean the car stinks . george does the car stink ?
stinks .
hey i 've never smelled in my life buddy .
that 's from the car .
thank you very much well then go out and smell the car see which smells worse .
you 've got to smell the car
c 'mon . one whiff .
alright will you pay for the cleaning ?
let 's do it .
wait a minute . it still smells . it still smells .
it still smells .
i do n't know .
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do i 'm selling that car .
you do n't understand what i 'm up against . this is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine . even superman would be helpless against this kind of stench . and i 'll take anything i can get for it .
are you crazy ? do n't you understand what i 'm saying to you ? this is not just an odour you need a priest to get rid of this thing .
you see . you see what i 'm saying to you ? it 's a presence . it 's the beast .
susan .
what is going on ?
that 's the least of what you 've accomplished
NUM .
that 's strange
NUM NUM .
wait a second my jacket . i wore that in the car . the beast .
this thing has got to be stopped .
oh drake 's party i forgot to buy a present .
you do n't like the drake ?
how could you not like the drake ?
the drake is good .
elaine look . i drew this triangle free hand . it 's a doodle . it 's perfect .
easy ?
do you like the drake ?
it 's isosceles
the chip in .
yeah .
you know what let 's go to that mall in liberal before we go to the party . we 'll have to take your car it 's got the most room .
what about your father 's car ?
are you serious ?
how about this you put your car in the good spot that 'll hold the good spot in front of the good building and we can get the good car .
good to meet you .
we could get him anything we wanted we 're chipping in .
yeah that 's a good idea . i 'll tell you what chuckles i give you permission to sublet my room right now .
yes they do .
well there 's spaces there they must drive .
do you believe the deal we got on this ? a big screen tv ? at that price ?
no one 's going to have a better gift than this big screen tv . good for them love the drake .
hey what 's going on over here ?
hey what 's going on ?
is she ok ?
son 's of bitches . good luck finding them him whatever . i 'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself but i got to take off .
i do n't know
i love the drake .
let 's get out of here .
the thing is even if we go back by the car and there 's nobody there how do we know they 're not all hiding waiting for us ?
what are we john dillinger ? how did this get to be the crime of the century ? it 's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying
i got it . we give the keys to elaine .
yeah . you 're a woman . men do n't hit a woman .
not if they do n't know you
what if we created some sort of diversion ? what if we all went by the car and started screaming there he is there 's the guy that took the handicap spot . and then when they all run into the other direction we 'll jump in the car .
that does n't work we 'll give em kramer .
you know a lot of these scratches will buff right out
so it was a good party huh ? oh you 're welcome you 're welcome they loved the tv loved it .
oh wait a second i 'll ask her that 's a great idea . drake wants to know if we want to come out to minneolis this afternoon since we missed the partly last night to maybe get something to eat ?
sure . okay do n't worry i 'm taking my car . okay okay see you later bye
the drake is great .
yeah . well i do n't know if i 'm happy for them i mean i 'm glad they 're happy but frankly that does n't do anything for me .
yes ?
come on up .
st . elizabeth 's hospital ? why ?
wow what happened ?
what ?
oh what 's the difference you do n't go out that much .
i am going to make good use of this . i 'm watching every superbowl here every big fight
so where 're we eatin ?
when did this happen ?
look at the picture on this thing
they know how to make em
well we should
yeah hey drake what ever happens i am sure it 'll be for the best .
he gave her all the gifts he felt guilty .
i know it is .
i hate the drake . maybe the whole thing was a scam . anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all . maybe they 're on their way to chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again .
do n't worry they 'll make friends fast with that nice tv .
hey guess what ? the drake broke up .
i do n't know about defraying .
we 're not getting that tv .
you are .
because that 's your thing .
yeah that 's your thing .
you know i 'm thinking about getting a yo yo .
yeah .
charity ? . ? that 's apalling .
your father got arrested ? for what ?
ho ly .
so what are you going to do ?
what ?
what 's the matter ?
what 's over ?
she dumped you ?
drop dead ?
she 's pretty rough .
NUM bucks ?
used ?
that 's their policy .
to me the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel . are we going to have to have aa type meetings for these people ? they 'll go hi my name is bill and the one thing i 'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream colored couch . according to most studies people 's number one fear is public speaking . number two is death . death is number two . now this means to the average person if you have to go to a funeral you 're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy .
look we 've been through this already . you 're not an actor .
i know . so why do we need two people in the show that ca n't act ?
my grandmother 's in the hospital .
this is real believable .
it stinks .
say something funny .

what 'd you think ?
hey .
ah you 're screwed .
how about our little elaine huh ? attended the finest finishing schools on the eastern seaboard . equestrian competitions . debutante balls . look at her now . interviewing mohels .
what 's the matter ?
what now ?
hospital receives grant to conduct dna research government funds genetic research at area hospital yeah so ?
oh will you stop it . just because a hospital studying dna research does n't mean they 're creating a race of mutant pig men .
believe me there 'd be plenty of women going for these pig men . whatever the deformity is there 's always some group of perverts that 's attracted to it . oo that little tail really turns me on . '
oh what 's the matter this does n't interest you ?
hey george you ever see one ?
so what 'd you think ?
alright i 'm waiting . i i want to see the pig man . show me the pig man .
maybe he 's just a guy with a nose like this . you know a lot of people have a nose like this they 're not necessarily pig men .
well if i hear an anguished oink' i 'm outta here . i i do n't see any pig men . look human human human wait a second .
oh it 's george .
alright kramer enough of this . let 's go find george .
kramer .
where 's the mohel ?
he 's late already .
i do n't know why he asked me to be the godfather . we 're not even that close of friends . just cause we 're on the softball team i 'm the pitcher he 's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship ?
well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but i 'm just lobbing it in . we do n't have any conferences . he does n't come out to the mound and encourage me .
do n't they have any closer friends . they 're level jumping on our friendship .
hello .
yeah . i 'm holding the baby .
i 'm going .
i 'm going .
do n't push me .
hurry up george . step on it .
that damn mohel he circumcised my finger . the mohel circumcised my finger .
flinched ? i did not flinch . george did i flinch ?
who 's got a tissues ? i need more tissues . look at this thing . it 's my phone finger .
oh the baby 's fine . they just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure . but look at me . i 'm the one who 's hurt .
a few stitches ? i 've never had stitches . i 'll be deformed . i ca n't live with that . it goes against my whole personality . it 's not me .
that was a one in a million mohel .
look at this .
oh well if it is n't shakey the mohel . nice job on the circumcision but it 's not supposed to be a finger .
oh who made you a mohel ? whadya get your degree from a matchbook ?
nice mohel picking elaine . you picked a helluva mohel .
oh do n't threaten me butcher boy .
ya what was this ?
it was not .
i ca n't do it . look what they did to my boy they massacred my boy .
oh that 's the flicks .
myra stan .
what 's the matter ?
professional tennis . to me i do n't understand all the shushing . why are they always shushing . shh shh . do n't the players know that we 're there ? should we duck down behind the seats so they do n't see us watching them ? to me tennis is basically just ping pong and the players are standing on the table . that 's all it is . and that goofy scoring you win one point and all the sudden you 're up by NUM . two points NUM love . NUM love . sounds like an english call girl . that 'll be NUM love and could you be a little quieter next time please shh .
are these seats unbelievable or what ?
here .
what are you on mercury ?
you got a problem with paba ?
you do n't even know what paba is .
i 'll go if someone else drives . you going ?
you 're bringing a date to a party ?
a party is a bad date situation . it does n't matter who you 're with . you could be with j . edgar hoover . you do n't want to sit and talk with hoover all night . you want to circulate . ho ho ho .
well i would think with the law enforcement and the cross dressing . seems like an interesting guy .
that woman is absolutely stunning .
not the croat the lineswoman . that is the most beautiful lineswoman i 've ever seen .
b . l . ?
i ca n't take my eyes off that lineswoman . the woman is absolutely mesmerizing .
i got to talk to her . what do you think ?
i 'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals .
i have to . i wo n't be able to live with myself .
i ca n't .
i do n't know hi .
excuse me . excuse me ? oh that 's nice . that 's right ignore me . that 's real polite . yea nobody 's even talking to you . all you big lineswoman . oh you 've got some kind of a cool job . i know your type thinking your too good for everyone but it 's women like you oh well what are you deaf ?
i 'm not saying she 's deaf she 's deaf .
ca n't hear a thing .
yeah is n't that something ?
really ?
i met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match .
wow good plan .
that 's nice .
that 's nice for the freaks .
why do n't you get him some tickets or something how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency .
kramer i think perhaps you 've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity . it 's ball boys not ball men . there are no ball men .
all right i 'll talk to her . if you want to be a ball man go ahead break the ball barrier . hey .
but i thought things were going great .
did she say why ?
but that 's your routine .
so she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it ? you really think she would be that superficial ?
hello oh hi dad you saw him ? really with the ice cream ? all right i 'll talk to you later bye .
yeah .
he thinks gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on tv .
well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place who withdraws ? what 's the etiquette ?
i think she should withdraw . she 's the breaker he 's the breakee . he needs to get on with his life .
really .
well i do n't care i do n't want to go anyway . i do n't want to fight that traffic on friday night .
really ?
okay .
oh i got a date with laura the lineswoman .
why ? well what are you doing ?
oh uh do you want to come with us ?
let 's get the check . is this uh considered signing ? do you do this when you want the check ?
really . i know a sign that 's my first sign .
she reads lips .
what ?
she 's not a novelty act george . where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas .
i do n't know george . i 'm not sure about this .
all right .
uh laura george was wondering if
so i really had a good time .
so you want to go to the party on friday night ?
all right we 're taking a car service . so we 'll swing by and pick you up . how about six ? . six is good . . you got a problem with six ? . what ? what ?
see i was saying six but she thought i was saying sex . we straightened the whole thing out though .
yeah .
well six and sex are close .
eh .
well i 'm not dating any other deaf women .

ca n't do it newman .
it 's not going to happen .
uh just pull over right there by the stop sign .
i said pull over by the stop sign .

hey todd .
hi tide ?

kramer .

how did i gain eight ?
me either . wait a second . wait a second . maybe it 's that yogurt .
well how else could this have happened ?

no eight years is n't such a long streak .

no elaine he 's normal . your boyfriend is a normal guy . he just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of new york .
but you like your joel rifkin .

if someone asked me nicely . i 'm claude seinfeld .
yeah . eighteen strangles .
hey did you hear that george got back with karen ?
risotto .
yeah . he 's really got a good thing with her . in fact i 'm doubling with them tonight .
george likes them he feels it 's a good personality showcase . he likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality .
he feels he 's funnier more relaxed .
jody the masseuse .
no . how many times do i have to go out with her before i get a massage ?
yeah i know she just wants to have sex .
so it 's like going to idhao and eating carrots . i like carrots but i 'm in idhao i want a potato .
my neck is killing me . right in this spot . very tender over here .
it 's like somebody 's pulling on wires back here .
yeah . let 's go .
yeah . good seeing you again karen .
i strained my neck last night .
i tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side . it did n't work .
no deal . why ?
oh well he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality .
yeah . sometimes he really makes me tense
yeah he 's disgusting .
yeah me either .
yeah he 's a bad seed .
what are you doing ?
yeah .
no . the sex was fabulous .
i want the massage .
i tried putting her hands there but she pulls it away immediately she 's not into it .
i guess cause it 's her job . it 's very frustrating .
yeah .
yeah .
she had a good time .
pretty much .
what ?
yeah
i was blowing on the coffee .
look it 's not like you 're going to be spending a lot of time with her .
no .
yes .
yes .
i do n't like him .
not everybody likes everybody .
you were very nice .
it has nothing to do with her sister .
oh no . that was the dry heaves .
jodi .
what are you doing here ?
kramer .
i 'll see you tonight .
who told you to get a massage from her . i have n't gotten a massage from her yet .
so you had a good time .
enjoyed yourself .
all right now you listen and you listen good .
the massages are out .
ahh . they 're out .
because if i ca n't get one you 're not getting one .
i 'm sorry kramer .
do n't you ever talk about her like that .
that 's final .
what 's the matter with you ?
you just had one yesterday . what do you need another one for ?
oh please .
well did you get the ball ?
well i never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game .
why do n't you get somebody else ?
well that 's it . tonight 's the night . i 'm getting one . no if ando s or but 's .
ask newman .
hi .
ah no problem . that 's fine .
that 's new age music . sounds of the forest . i find it soothing . hey look at this . what do you know ? a massage table . this is great .
just checking it out . look at how this thing is made . can i tell you something ? that 's a hell of a piece of equipment .
no nonsense . this one 's fine .

why what 's wrong ?
no . yes you can .
come on . i know it 's something you want to do .

you need to talk ?
george anything you have to say to her you can say in front of me .
what ?
i can see that .
do n't worry .
you 're a lucky guy .
george . i would n't push for the massage .
the swedish are very big massagers . you know ? they like the swedish meatballs swedish massage . they like having meat in their hands these people for some reason . but it 's weird because they have the highest suicide rate they 're rubbing each other 's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense . i do n't really like the idea of getting a professional massage . i do n't want people touching me that do n't know me and do n't want to have sex with me . you know what are you bothering me for ? you get me all loosened up juices flowing and then that 's it ok you 're done . it 's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face you know you want to go excuse me i think you missed a spot .
how would you describe the smell in this house ?
yeah that 's part of it . kasha ?
yeah . dandruff kasha mothballs cheap carpeting . it 's pot pourri really .

my indian ?
well why would i assume . i never assume . leads to assumptions .
why ?
well it 's too late . i gave it to elaine and she 's already on her way to give it to george 's father .
you ca n't give something and then take it back . i mean what are you
a uh a person that uh
well a person that gives something and then they 're dissatisfied and they wish they had had never uh
give given it to the person that they originally gave it to .
i 'm sorry i 'm not familiar with that term .
i do n't know why we did n't think of this before . we just could call tv guide .
well it 's going to make mr costanza very happy .
what 's the matter ?
it is a good idea elaine .
you want a gyro ?
elaine .
i was always excited as a kid when that new tv guide would come . somehow when that front cover 's nice and flat seems like there 's good fresh tv shows in . then as the weeks go by you start to hate the tv guide . all the shows stink . everything 's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on thrown across the room . tv guide is always thrown never handed to another person . it 's the worldo s most thrown reading material . where 's tv guide ? there it is . you know in the back of the tv guide they have a phone number ninety five cents a minute they will give you the answers to the tv guide crossword puzzle ? my question is if you ca n't do the tv guide crossword puzzle where are you coming across ninety five cents ?
then he asked you out ?
on your heart ?
doctor ? he 's a podiatrist .
anyone can get into podiatry school . george got into podiatry school .
oh hi .
yes i 'll be stopping .
see you later . well we ca n't all be dating podiatrists .
how did you get in ?
looks like a swan .
she 's limiting herself to latvian orthodox ? too bad .
oh whatever .
mmm succulent .
to latvian orthodox ?
you know it 's not like changing toothpaste .
yeah well king edward did n't live in queens with frank and estelle costanza .
oh yeah .
oh i do n't know . not always . no i uh i had to work at it . when i was a kid all the kids would be out playing i would be up in my room practicing my kissing .
to wash my hands . they 're sticky from the orange .
right there .
fungicide . fungus ?
fungicide . i mean what could she have ?
exactly
i said i was coming down with the flu or something and i had to go home .
i did n't open it . it was open . i just nudged it a little .
i was not snooping . i did not break the seal . there was no breaking and entering . i would n't do that .
why do n't you ask that doctor what it is ?
but that 's what podiatrists do . they deal in fungus . they 're knee deep in fungus . this guy knows fungus .
what ?
that 's all there is to it .
and when is brother costanza planning on telling mother costanza ?
oh a slinky .
why did she give you that ?
what do you mean she liked you ?
you picked up on a vibe from a nun .
yea alright .
oh hi .
a little better .
okay .
all right .
bye .
she 's subletting carol 's place for a month .
yeah but there 's a problem . i found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet .
so i do n't know what she 's using it for .
i did n't even think to look .
yeah .
yeah i 've got this old bottle of cough medicine .
hi
hi . can i use your bathroom ?
fine all done just looking for the soap .
no i do n't see it .
okay latvius was the son of which apostle ? and i 'll need that in the form of a question .
hey did you talk to the doctor ?
all right the next time you see him show him this .
not on purpose . i was hoping there would be a name on the tube . when are you seeing him again ?
how could you say that ?
i was merely speaking extemporaneously .
me too .
yes . he 's a doctor . wait a second . what are you doing ?
matthew luke paul' what you 're cheating on your conversion chest ?
what ?
who ?
how do you know ?
wow
what is that stench ? i got it . ah hah .
hey . what are you doing ?
the kavorka ? what 's that ?
what is this thing around your neck ?
you know you 're funcifying the whole building .
kramer . kramer .
good . what 's the matter ?
bonkers ?
oh it 's your cat .
ooh nothing .
elaine it 's her cat . her cat had the fungus . so i need the tube back .
but once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you 're never using it again . any medicine you 're using is on the sink . it 's not really even a medicine cabinet it 's really like an ointment museum is n't it ? it 's like here 's a saff from NUM some cream from the NUMs . but you want to keep it private because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out . somebody peeks in there oh i see mr . perfect needs tough acting tinactin . well i guess i 'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on . '
the whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal . you know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away . how extensive their vocabulary is . i would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary . i would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching quervo beach volleyball tournament . if you want to maintain the brainy mammal image .
hmm i love this artificial flavoring i like it better than butter i think it 's more consistent
what ?
who do you think she is ? how dare she ? you want me to get the manager ? too bad they do n't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we 'd flush her out
i wonder where elaine is sitting ? i really wanted you to meet her she 's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend tony

why do you do that ?
hey where were you last night ? i looked for you i did n't see you
oh with huh pretty boy tony
hey hey
tony hey hey
huh huh
no what ?
oh whoa
well maybe she could n't spare it
well you know sometimes a square is everything
elaine you cannot judge a person on a situation like that . i mean it 's like asking for someone 's canteen in the desert
it 's battle conditions
oh jane she uh she uh
yeah that should be real fun
yeah
hey andre get the hell off the phone .
kramer 's andre he 's fooling around with these NUM numbers hey i told you i do n't want you doing that on my phone

elaine
different for a man
we 're expected to be superficial

and that 's why you 're going out with him
you know i think george has a non sexual crush on him
i mean every time i see him it 's tony this tony that . george is like a school girl around him
yeah yeah what is it with you and tony ? what are you ? it 's like his sidekick now ?
cool guy ? what are you in NUM grade ?

well it 's too much it 's embarrassing
she 's one of these people always have to be different
well
well aside from that from that how did he like the sandwiches ?
i 've been waiting a while for this . you know it 's a shame tony got all banged up we 're not going to be able to get together on saturday night

selling sexual pleasure over the phone ?
paper goods ?
thanks
now of the course the thing is extreme sports . bungie jumping . to me if bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy . just leaning does not make it a sport . it 's like a wiley coyote idea is n't it ? the thing i wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets ? can you almost make it ? why do n't they just wear a party hat ? what 's the difference ? you jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute does n't open i got news for you the helmet is now wearing you for protection . later on the helmet 's talking to the other helmets going boy it 's a good thing he was there or i would have hit the ground directly .
i once got happy new yeared in march .
it 's pathetic . . . . hey is it cold out ?
scary cold .
that .
when did you get that ?
you like saying gore tex do n't you ?
look at this
yeah .
the fabric of society is very complex george .
i tell you george i do n't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of pepsi in the middle of the table .
you know you 're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself .
you are . i ca n't get that thing in my car .
where 's the heat in this car ? come on elaine warm me up oh . i 'm cold . just give me a little squeeze .
you 're pretty comfortable up there eh bubble boy ?
jerry .
mmm . oh look elaine the black and white cookie .
i love the black and white . two races of flavor living side by side in harmony . it 's a wonderful thing is n't it ?
i 'm looking forward to it .
thank you . all right look at all this stuff . what are we getting ?
love that babka .
so listen elaine when we get up to the door you you hold the cake box .
i do n't know just standing there with a box holding it by the little string .
it 's a tad dainty .
oh see that 's not fair . we we were here ahead of all these people .
ah no forget it .
well we saw you come in .
david .
oh so you still do n't believe us .
see you later .
that 's the last babka . they got the last babka .
that was our babka .
we had that babka .
well what are we going to do now . if we ca n't get the babka the whole thing 's useless .
carrot cake ? now w why is that a cake ? you do n't make carrots into a cake . i 'm sorry .
black forrest ? too scary . you 're in the forrest oohh .
how about a napoleon ?
that was our babka . we had that babka .
another babka ?
well well we got to get the cinnamon .
i beg your pardon ? cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka . people love cinnamon . it should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper . anytime anyone says oh this is so good . what 's in it ? the answer invariably comes back cinnamon . cinnamon . again and again . lesser babka i think not .
and a black and white cookie for me . peace .
uhm see the key to eating a black and white cookie elaine is you want to get some black and some white in each bite . nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate . and yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us . if people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved .
hmm . look to the cookie elaine look to the cookie .
what ?
oh oh take it back . let 's get another one .
no no come on really get another one . it 'll take a second .
well i 'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it .
a little hair ? do you think that makes it better ?
what if it 's your hair ?
who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store . i use prell the hard stuff . hundred proof takes your roots out .
well maybe we should just forget about the cake ?
no . that 's out of the question .
because i had a bad experience with a hair when i was younger .
i 'd rather not talk about it .
all right . . . . i once found a hair in my farina and i freaked out .
yeah .
well i started screaming there 's a hair in my farina . there 's a hair in my farina . then i ran out of the house and i was running and running . and like i was little but i could run very fast . and i i just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site .
my mother 's .
oh good .
oh that 's lovely .
that 's what you want to see yeah . . . . yeah you want to trade your hair for some phlegm .
yeah that 's a good deal you win the pennant with that trade hair for phlegm .
huh wa ?
i do n't know i do n't feel so good .
my stomach i think it was that cookie .
yeah .
i think i got david duke and farrakhan down there .

golden boy 's always the first shirt i wear out of the laundry . here touch golden boy .
but see look at the collar it 's fraying . golden boy is slowly dying . each wash brings him one step closer that 's what makes the t shirt such a tragic figure .
no . the reason he 's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game . wash . spin . rinse . spin . you take that away from him you break his spirit .
the guy who 's in the gulag ? .
you want to barrow golden boy .
hey ya know i read an unbelievable thing about tolstoy the other day did you know the original title for war and peace was war what is it good for ? ' .

you told testikov that tolstoy wanted to name his book war what is it good for ? ?
can i take a guess ?
oh i do n't know he threw your organizer out the window ?
because i know who has it .
because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name called me up and we met .
i do n't have it .
because she 's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill .
how much is testikov getting from pendant for this book ?
well that 's a start .

come on try it . a little taste . come on .
she would n't so much as taste it .
no . she would n't say anything . she just kept shaking her head like this
no . she carries entemanns doughnuts in her purse .
the only thing i can think of is i told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city .
yeah .
tell me about it .
they could at least try it .
what 's the harm ?
i 'm sorry . there 's no reason for her not to taste that pie .
audrey .
boy i never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie ?
you did ?
boy i never heard of that happening to a woman ?
uh may i help you ?
keep it .
uh excuse me . i could n't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie .
and you waved it away .
did you give her a reason ?
you were full . so you gave a reason . you did n't just shake your head .
exactly . you 're not a psycho . you 've been very helpful . thank you very much . allow me to leave the tip . well i think we proven who the psycho is .
i think you know my policy .
no he 's going downtown to guard the suit .
i ca n't beleive your father owns this place . so how are the desserts here ?
you 've tasted them ?
oh i see they have apple pie .
you 've had the apple pie ?
audrey i got to be honest with you . i 'm a very curious guy . it 's my nature . i need to know things . not tasting the apple pie the other day i ca n't get past it . you obviously like pies . you carry doughnuts in your bag you 're not averse to pastry . surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind .
why ca n't i know ?
hello poppie .
the pies . i 'm going to the bathroom . you know .
huh ?
no nothing .
so she tought i did it to get back at her
i do n't think that 's the kind of thing you want to hear about your father . but i 'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough it was a wild scene .
even if you 're not going to soap up at least pretend for my benefit . turn the water on do something .
you know a chef who does n't wash is like a cop who steals . it 's a cry for help he wants to get caught .
we have n't spoken .
yeah and poppie 's got problems
yeah all right . go ahead .
hum ok what else you got ?
oh because i did n't think the blind guy did it ?
georgio . nice duds .

so you think you 're not going to get the job because your pants make a noise ?
you know i think all these interviews are making you nuts .
audrey ?
was it apple ?
this woman is bending my mind into a pretzel .
oh i got to see this thing .

kramer you ca n't keep avoiding her like this you 're going to have to say something .
tell her you lost your itch .
well you should tell her .

it 's not good .
well at breakfast everybody reads .

hiya newman .
say i happened to catch you coming out of schindler 's list the other night .
yes i was .
yes shocking brutality do n't you think ?
yes well that was nothing .
yeah that 's real interesting . elaine listen tell me if you think this is funny men definitely hit the remote more than women men do n't care what 's on tv men only care what else is on tv . women want to see what the show is before they change the channel because men hunt and women nest . '
you do n't know ? come on that 's gold .
oh that 's gold baby .
i was saying baby way before george .
well this guy leonard christian 's going to be there tomorrow night .
he 's a writer from entertainment weekly . i would like to have a good show .
yeah .
well you better laugh cause i 'm being reviewed . leonard christian 's going to be there .
well you want to sit with george ? i think he 's coming with robin .
yeah .
yeah you should see george get along with this kid .
hey ronnie .
can i have a club soda ? going on tonight ?
yeah .
yeah i know .
i do n't think so .
i do n't i dunno .
oh is this a bit ?
hey .
really . you know a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now too .
oh you 'll have a good time i swear .
good good .
yeah why do n't you guys get a table so you 'll have good seats ?
yeah .
ok good i 'll see you later .
men definitely hit the remote button more than women
yes yeah see men do n't care what 's on tv men only care what else is on tv .
see women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel
that 's why men hunt and women nest .
yea ya so anyway what was i talking about .
hey what 's the deal ? what was going on there ? i invite you down here i have an important show and she heckles me ? .
well what is the matter with her ? is she crazy ? .
hey . what is wrong with you ? .
y you boo me ? . you hiss ? . you did n't stop blathering throughout the whole set .
no . not part of the show . booing and hissing are not part of the show . you boo puppets . you hiss villains in silent movies .
oh i can take it .
did you knock her over too or just the kids ?
really ? her mother .
you probably could n't see because of the smoke .
hmm . so you feel women and children first in this day and age is somewhat of an antiquated notion .
so basically it 's every man woman child and invalid for themselves .
yeah well it 's honest .
well perhaps when she 's released from the burn center she 'll see things differently .
so what was the fire ? just a couple of greasy hamburgers ?
by the way did you see this ?
it 's the leonard christian article about my show . plus my gig in miami got cancelled i betcha it 's because of the article .
i should have let her have it . i held back because of kramer .
yeah right .
yeah that 'd be something .
but would n't that be the ultimate comedian 's revenge ? i 've always had a fantasy about doing that .
why ca n't i ?
you know what ? i think i 'm going to do that . she came down to where i work i 'll go down to where she works .
there 's no precedent baby .
hey nice shoes . what you wear sandals to work ? it 's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet . that 's real conducive to the work atmosphere . i 'm sure your co workers really appreciate it . hey let 's go eat in toby 's office . great idea . we can check on her bunions . '
oh is this disruptive ? you find it hard to work with someone interrupting ?
security ? well i do n't know how you 're going to make it in this business if you ca n't take it . ya got to be tough . booo . boooo .
boo .
hiss .
because she came down to the club and heckled me . give her a taste of her own medicine .
well i did n't want her to have an accident .
you kept making all the stops ?
she got the promotion ?
why ?
too bad .
because elaine that 's the one that goes wee wee wee all the home . '
i went down to the magazine i pleaded with him to come and see me again finally he agreed to come down tonight and he 's going to write another article .
damn right . we 've been lapdogs long enough .
yeah well it 's about time one of us drew a line in the sand .
yeah well it wo n't be long .
got to go .
i mean bozo the clown i mean does he really need the clowng in his title as clown ? bozo the clown ? are we going to confuse him with bozo the district attorney ? bozo the pope ? there 's no other bozo
that 's why men hunt and women nest .
george could i have a word ?
kramer i 've driven to east hampton many times i know the exit .
you sure we 're making the right move ?
did n't they just have a baby ?
is it possible they 're just having babies to get people to visit them ?
no .
no not for me . a little too delightful . well george and jane should be almost there by now .
i know george is pretty pleased about it . it 's like she signed a letter of intent .
she 's making the three o'clock train .
i bought him some kishka .
it 's kind of a stuffed meat thing . israeli soldiers carry it . in case they 're captured behind enemy lines they eat it and it kills them .
who are you mrs . robinson ?
no that 's no sweet'ning the deal . no .
no thanks .
and then there 's maude .
no lines .
so when are we going to see this baby ? when is the momentous event ?
oh this is interesting .
jane 's topless .
boutros boutros ghali .
oh in a minute carol .
this is weird wild stuff . george has n't even seen her yet .
oh here she comes .
no thanks .
so very gorgeous .
is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen ?
boy a little too much chlorine in that gene pool . and you know the thing is they 're never going to know no one 's ever going to tell them .
it 's a must lie situation .
you know i do n't think we should tell george we saw jane topless .
in fact remind me to tell kramer too .
ah i 'm going to go pick up rachel at the station .
okay .
oh i like that . it 's like going back in time .
she 's got greeting problems .
well the tomato 's an anomaly . so successful with the ketchup and the sauce but you ca n't find a good one .
you got lobster for everybody ?
all right .
well when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless .
no .
yeah .
think of me as a doctor .
well what 'd you mean ?
they 'd pick her up in about ten minutes .
i guess that 's true
what do you want me to do ? you want to see rachel naked ?
you can see me naked . i can offer you that .
i 've never been called breathtaking either .
maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room .
how are you going to do that ?
you might have .
you wo n't .
yes george . i 'm kind of wondering myself . what is it what you want ?
oh . so you were swimming in the pool and you wanted some gum .
wait 'll you get to know him .
oh check it out . i guarantee you 've never seen anything quite so objectionable . it 's down the hall third door on your left .
it was my fault i told her the wrong door .
so what ?
but
oh you mean shrinkage .
so you feel you were short changed .
well so what 's the difference ?
oh she 's not going to tell jane .
women are n't like us .
no i 'm not going to tell her about your shrinkage . besides i think women know about shrinkage .
is n't it common knowledge ?
elaine . get .
like when a man goes swimming afterwards
like a frightened turtle .
no .
no you do n't want to do that . you 'll be uncomfortable .
yeah the lobster 'll scare him .
easy big fella .
you told her ?
you do n't understand . this organ it 's very schizophrenic .
oh that 's just jane driving home to new york in the middle of the night .
hey look at this guy .
yeah .
geez these are delicious . where did you learn to make eggs like this ?
well i guess i got to go too .
i still ca n't believe michael finked on kramer .
they got some sort of program .
hey is n't that michael 's car ?
you got a raise ?
i thought you said pendant was in financial trouble .
oh when did that happen ?
does this mean they 're going to be publishing kramer 's coffee table book ?
boy you 're on quite a streak . job promotion plus you 're back with jake jarmal .
boy you really got it all i 'm sure helen girlie brown would be very proud of you .
speaking of having it all where were you ?
oh the beach .
what is it that is n't working ?
could i get napkin over there ?
you know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna salmon is the opposite of tuna cuz salmon swim against the current and the tuna swim with it .
well here 's your chance to try the opposite . instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women chicken salad and going right up to them .
if every instinct you have is wrong then the opposite would have to be right .
are you kidding ? they ca n't cancel that show on me now it 's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend . alright alright okay bye .
what 's happening ?
oh yeah i heard all about it .
you 're going on regis and kathy lee ?
i 'll loan you my puffy shirt .
what 're you going to talk about ?
hello ? what ? yeah sure i 'll do it . i just had something cancelled the same weekend . ok . great . bye . you know life is amazing . i just lost a job and five minutes later get another same weekend same money .
broke even .
so it 's all over ?
and what did you go back for ? jujyfruit ?
why did n't you eat it in the cab ?
played cards last night .
broke even .
yeah i know like yesterday i lost a job and then i got another one and then i missed a tv show and later on they re ran it . and then today i missed a train went outside and caught a bus . it never fails . i always even out .
what for ?
what the hell was that ?
you know you couldo ve thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back .
well maybe next time someone 's in a car accident you wo n't stop off for candy first .
bad .
so you just did the opposite of everything ?
so i guess your messiah would be the anti christ .
elaine look . a twenty .
i 'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is . if you 're going out with someone your size right there you double your wardrobe .
oh come on that 's a huge feature . when they approach a new recruit i 'm sure that 's one of the big selling points .
yes ?
uh huh ?
oh that 's okay .
nah that 's fine . no problem . i 'll meet somebody else .
sure . see things always even out for me .
it 's fine . anyway it 's been really nice dating you for a while . and uh good luck .

kramer you got to explain to her what happened .
oh it was just kramer apparently i killed miss rhode islando s doves with a bucket of water last night .
i heard those doves were really incredible .
it 's like watching an animal get tortured .
oh great . alright .
that 's a shame .
why did you give him my number ?

call me when the pencil comes in okay ?
why does mr . pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway ? hey . look who 's here .
hi julie .
just had a big bowl of kix .
big lettuce big carrots tomatoes like volleyballs .
dating is really starting to get embarrassing is n't it ?
people on dates should n't even be allowed out in public .
it 's embarrassing for them . it 's painful for us to watch . i 'm going out with someone later i 'm not even taking her out of the house .
i do n't need a bunch of people staring at us .
what was that ?
certainly are .
all right . you 're in my face .
hello . no she 's not here . okay fine whatever . i 'll tell her . okay . goodbye . the stationery store guy called to say he ordered your pencil .
he does n't even care if a man answers .
bye bye
well that all depends . . .
yeah so ?
is that a fact ?
no it is n't .
yes you did .
she could have .
imagine her taking credit for your big salad .
obviously .
what ?
well it has nothing to do with you .
well generally speaking you do n't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner . i would n't worry about that .
and kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it .
ah no i do n't think so .
we do n't need a bunch of people staring at us .
oh they 're staring . they know we 're on a date . they 're making fun . come on . it 's embarrassing .
hello . no she 's not here . yes i will tell her . no i do n't know what time she might be coming back . look i got to go . goodbye . . . . that that 's a long story .
hello newman .

. . . he ended it ?
no no of course not .
what tee ?
newman . she went out with newman .
no . it is n't and the most distressing part of it is not that she went out with him but that he stopped seeing her . do you understand ? he newman newman stopped seeing her . newman never stopped seeing anybody . newman will see whoever is willing to see him . not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is . but why did he newman stop seeing her ?
no there 's less .
no it is n't . i 've looked into his eyes . he 's pure evil .
yeah he 's a mystery wrapped in a twinkie .
no but thank you .
oh by the way your stationery store guy called and he 's got your pencil .

a long talker .

i 've never seen him in manhattan before it 's weird . so out of context .
i believe he is wearing a cape .

well she is a woman .
really ?
hey would n't it be funny if paul ang noreen broke up because o you kept hanging up on him ?
well you know if paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with noreen ?

first you ruin her relationship with the high talker .
so she breaks up with him . somehow picks up the pieces of her life . miraculously meets a new guy . ya bust that up . ang then just as they 're reconciling you announce to the world he 's boring .
well apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does .

boy it 's the way they just slip it in there too .
well let me ask you this . what exactly did you say when you asked her out ?

well she got up to the line of scrimmage did n't like the looks of the defense and changed the play .
uh huh .
you did ?
yeah . you said you liked horse manure .
mm hm .
and it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend ?
i 'm just saying there 's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure .
my honest opinion i think she made it up .
aaa . well you want something to eat do n't you ?
well i 'm glad it 's working out .
boy if i could meet a hostess we could open up our own place .

then that 's the meal .
i did n't tell you to have a hot dog . who told you to have a hot dog ?

so he just gets soup . he wants to save the meal . so now i got to do it all over again .
i do n't know ? consomm&eacute or something .

elaine you 're missing the whole point .
the meal is the act of sitting down with him . it does n't matter what you get as long as he 's sitting in that restaurant its a meal .
you see ah uh

i think yes yes . you like the idea of telling people you 're driving jon voight 's car .
hey .
i really do n't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled .
alright take em .
i like jon voight . just seems like kindo ve a strange reason to buy a car because he might have driven it .
i do n't know .
do n't you see that 's the genius of it . if he had said liam neeson you 'd know he 's making it up .
oh look at this i stepped in gum .

oh look . there 's gregory peck 's bicycle .
and barbara mandrell 's skateboard .
no they did n't even touch me . i tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots .

all right let 's be reasonable bania . i 'm taking you out for a nice dinner . all i want is a little ticket in that pocket . i think it 's a pretty good deal .
. . . all right just give me the ticket .
ohh
let me in it 's me . here . you do n't know what this is costing me .
the dry cleaning numbers are gone too .
give me that .
hey bania the dinners off . the ticket 's no good . the numbers are all smudged out .
the ticket is worthless .
hey is n't that my mother 's fur coat ?
it is . give me that back .
you ca n't have that coat it 's not yours .
what do you think the dry cleaner 's is your own personal closet .
yeah it 's very good .
yeah . i 'm having a wonderful time .
yeah yeah i know . this would be good but it would be the same . but if we go some place else it would be different but it might not be as good . it 's a gamble . i get it .
oh and who might that be ?
if you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant i 'm telling you right now i do n't want to hear about the specials . i do n't want to know about the specials . i 'm sick of the specials . i hate the specials . my feeling is if the specials were so special they 'd be on the menu . you know what 's special about them ? they do n't know if anybody likes them . they always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too you know . the veil is lightly slapped and then sequestered in a one bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous .
ready to go lois ?
excuse me lois . stand back lois . jimmy 's in trouble lois .
duncan meyers .
well i 'd have to be superman to do that lois .
hi oh .
she could n't make it .
i know finally . but george guess who her boss is . duncan meyers .
elaine only one other person in the world knows what i am about to tell you and that 's george . when we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet .
i was the last one on the end . george was next to me . and mr . bevilacqua the gym . . .
mr . bevilacqua the gym teacher .
he was down at the other end . so he yells out ready on your mark get set and i was so keyed up i just took off . by the time he said go i was ten yards ahead of everybody .
by the time the race was over i had won . i was shocked nobody had noticed the head start .
and i had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed . only duncan suspected something was a miss . he 's hated me ever since . now he 's back .
i never did . in four years of high school i would never race anyone again . not even to the end of the block to catch a bus . and so the legend grew . everyone wanted me to race . they begged me . the track coach called my parents . pleading . telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent . but i answered him in the same way i answered everyone . i chose not to run .
he 's back . and i knew he would be someday . man that 's some tart cider .
hi .
oh so am i . uh how 's duncan ?
he say anything ?
oh nothing in particular .
i did not cheat .
oh he 's just jealous because he came in second .
yes
faster than a speeding bullet lois .
i could n't tell her the truth . i do n't know what 's going to happen between us . what if we have a bad breakup . she 'll go straight to duncan . and i want him to go to his grave never being certain i got that
wow a communist . that 's something .
the daily worker has personal ads ?
yours or hers ?
wow look at you . so you got the job .
hello oh hi lois you want to get together what for ? i do n't know about that i 'll have to think about it . i 'll let you know . okay bye .
duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow . he obviously wants me to admit i got a head start . and i do n't think she believes me .
that 's not bad .
i did n't hit puberty til the NUM grade . that 's what gave me my speed . besides if i got a head start why did n't mr . bevilacqua stop the race ?
well i . . .
i 'm sorry uh
oh george costanza kennedy high .
this is lois .
i 'm i 'm a comedian .
yeah yeah
yeah yeah well you really got bald there did n't you ?
you really used to have a think full head of hair .
yeah yeah .
well you 've really built yourself up into something .
well one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this .
ah you know you have a hole in your sneaker there . what is that canvas ?
george george hang on . i have n't seen you in so long .
i thought we might reminisce a little more . you know duncan and i were just taking about the big race .
yeah .
george .
did i get a head start ?
you satisfied ? so you see ?
no no no another race out of the question .
all right . i 'll do it . the race is on .
and he 's calling all these people from high school to come and watch . i knew this day would come . i ca n't do it . i ca n't go through with it . i 'm calling it off . i ca n't let the legend die . it 's like a kid finding out there 's no santa claus
so you 'll just explain to him you 're not a communist . you just called the woman for a date .
hello oh hi duncan NUM NUM o'clock tomorrow ? that is not going to work . . . . why ? i 'll tell you why . because i chose not to run .
hi how are you ?
what 's the matter ?
what ? he ca n't do that .
do n't worry lois . i 'll think of something .
i need a miracle .
yes mr . beviacqua
yes mr . bevilacqua .
maybe i will lois . maybe i will .
come on . lets go
what 's it doin here ?
oh bruline . newman 's got the same one .
he 's fantastic .
you loaned her pitt 's racquet ?
oh ok . next time lets play ping pong . it 's easier to jump over the net .
bye bye
hm really ?
yeah it was ok . frankenstein did n't seem quite right to me . i missed the sport jacket .
not that it was that nice of a jacket . i mean it did n't fit him that well . to me there 's just something about a monster in a blazer . it shows at least he 's making an effort .
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
it was unbelievable . you 're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman .
and even when she did like something she does n't laugh . she says that 's funny . that 's funny .
i mean how can i be with someone that does n't laugh . it 's like well it 's like something .
what noise ?
what blah ?
oh you think she was refunding ?
in a manner of speaking .
thanks .
a matron ?
uh well i ca n't help you there .
kramer you 're going to have to face her some time
why did n't you just ask her for it ?
yeah
c 'mon up .
so when do you have to get the racquet back to mr . pitt ?
he needs a three hundred dollar bruline to beat ethyl kennedy ?
well why do n't you wait til she 's not there on her lunch hour and just take it ?
stealing ? you loaned her the racquet .
so what happened with kramer 's mother ?
what 's she like ?
what is it ?
we 've been trying to get it out of him for ten years . what is it ?
hi is sandy here ?
i would except i forgot to bring a towel .
so the roommate laughed at everything i said .
it was a great sounding laugh too kind of lilting and feminine none of those big coarse ha 's . you know those ?
yeah .
and the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the superficial man .
so as you can see i 've got a bit of a problem here .
ca n't be done huh ?
the switch . '
i wonder .
they did n't have roommates in the middle ages .
the point is i intend to undertake this . and i 'll do it with or without you . so if you 're scared if you have n't got the stomach for this let 's get it out right now . and i 'll go on my own . if not you can get on board and we can get to work . now what 's it going to be ?
i could n't do it without you .
aw we ca n't do it who are we kidding ? it 's impossible . it 's true . you ca n't do the switch . nobody can do the switch . it was a stupid idea to begin with . let 's face it . i 'm stuck with the non laugher and that 's that .
yeah sure we will .
all right . so i tell sandy that i want to have a m&eacute nage &agrave trois with her and her roommate .
and you believe this course of action will have a two pronged effect . firstly the very mention of the idea will cause sandy to recoil in disgust whereupon she will insist that i remove myself from the premises .
at this point it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events .
the roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request .
huh . well it all sounds pretty good . there 's only one flaw in it they 're roommates . she 'd have to go out with me behind sandy 's back . she 's not going to do that .
it 's a perfect plan . so inspired . so devious . yet so simple .
you know i do n't know the exact pronunciation but i believe its manage a trois .
uh ?
hey
ah that 's a shame .
yeah i did . in fact i went over there .
no actually she took it pretty well .
she 's into it .
the manage . and not only that . she just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate 's into the manage too .
oh it 's a scene man .
what are you talking about ? i 'm not going to do it .
i ca n't . i 'm not an orgy guy .
do n't you know what it means to become an orgy guy ? it changes everything . i 'd have to dress different . i 'd have to act different . i 'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and i 'd need a new bedspread and new curtains i 'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting . i 'd have to get new friends . i 'd have to get orgy friends . naw i 'm not ready for it .
oh shut up you could n't do it either .
hey what happened ? did you get your racquet ?
what do you mean you got caught ?
i still do n't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet .
hi cosmo .
hey does n't newman have a bruline racquet ?
hum but you 've got the key to his place right ?
well elaine needs to borrow his racquet . just for today .
you sure you do n't want the tickets ?
i ca n't believe i 'm having trouble getting rid of super bowl tickets .
i ca n't the drake put me in the wedding party .
maybe he did n't know ?
row f in front of the gs hobnobbing with the ds and es .
i asked . elaine laughed at me kramer 's only interested in canadian football .
come on take them . you could take bonnie .
what do you think ?
yeah sleeping arrangements . so you have n't uh
aah .
the dentist ?
oh no . i explained the whole thing to him he was fine with it .
yeah i blamed it on you . hi tim .

hey .
yes it is . i got it as a gift it 's a label baby junior .
tim whatley ?
one tim whatley .
the same he sent it as a thank you for my super bowl tickets .
or maybe he liked your gift so much he decided to get me the same thing . perhaps it 's an homage .
well how did he react when you gave it to him ?
he repeated the name of the gift ?
oh well if you repeat the name of the gift you ca n't possibly like it .
oh you know like when someone opens something up and they go oh . tube socks . what are you going to do about it ?
why 'd you get him a gift anyway ?
yeah well if you 're getting him anything for his birthday i 'm alarge .
male roommate huh ?
is this a problem ?
well maybe he 's
so he 's an eligible receiver .
what 's stopping them ?
what does he look like ?
he looks like you and he 's working from the inside ?
not you .
we 'll take a check please .
i know you would drape yourself in velvet .
many times . you love velvet you want to live in velvet everything with the velvet .
hey .
so what ?
oh maybe he 's got no hot water .
are you through ?
the wedding is off ? what happened ?
i ca n't call tim whatley and ask for the tickets back .
are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving ? there 's no grace period .
possibly .
you may have a point .
alright i 'll call him .
oh it 's risk it 's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives . hello tim ? yeah hi it 's jerry seinfeld remember those tickets i gave you ? well it turns out i can use them . oh you do ? i understand . okay . bye . he already made plans he ca n't change them .
thanks .
what are you going to do about the roommate ?
well the pickle breath is a good start .
what do you want ?
i 'm not letting you cheat newman . you 're not getting anywhere near that board .
you 're not a little anything newman . so just pack it up and move it out of here .
i dunno watch it on tv i guess . why ?

you go out with a guy one time you ask him to go upstairs like you 're mae west ? of course he 's going to try and get you alone for the weekend .

yeah well i do n't trust this guy . i think he regifted he degifted and now he 's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a super bowl sex romp .
hey . what are you doing ?
my door ?
what was that ?
the bedroom .
i see you newman . i see you .
so she kicked him out of the apartment .
wow she rearranged her whole life for you .

you wanted to be ensconced in velvet you 're buried .
he was shouldering .

what kind of person is this ? there 's only one other person who might be able to do something like this and that 's you .
i do n't even think you could do it .
yeah i guess you could .
did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment i bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the hair team for men just to put his mind at ease ?
yeah . oh i ca n't wait to talk to this guy .
why not ?
so you 're telling me because you 're getting free parking i got to pretend this guy had cancer when he did n't ?

the whip . in the senate in the house .
can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig ? would you do that ?
yeah .
and you know what else ? he picked up that woman in the coffee shop .
yeah .
because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee .
she thinks a guy who lies about a life threatening illness so he can get some phony hair has perspective ?
walked right over to her table .
you ever see what that thing looks like in the back ? you got your natural little curls on the bottom and then that big phony mat coming down on top of em .
what if you get involved with a woman ? how 're you going to tell her ?
so you keep it a secret your whole life then at your funeral the mortician comes out here mrs costanza i thought you might want this . aahh .
i really ca n't say .
it 's not good okay . it 's not good . you look stupid . i 'm sorry .
why do n't you get a pair of white shoes move down to miami beach and get the whole thing over with ?

all right . take it easy . take it easy .
i 'm sorry .
what ?
you know gary i had a little chat with george the other day
and he told me that that
