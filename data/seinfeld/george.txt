what a world that would be if you just could ask a woman what she 's thinking .
listen listen do n't get worked up cause you 're going to know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane .
cause it 's all in the greeting .
all right if she puts the bags down before she greets you that 's a good sign .
you know anything in the in the lip area is good .
you know a hug definitely good .
sure .
that 's so brutal i hate that .
that 's why you know a shake is bad .
hand sandwich .

oh no . no no no no .
i 'll tell you when it happened . when that floss came flying out of my pocket .
we were in the lobby during the intermission of the play . i was buying her one of those containers of orange drink for five dollars . i reached into my pocket to pay for it i looked down there 's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers .
of course . so i 'm looking at it . i look up i see she 's looking at it . our eyes lock . it was a horrible moment . i just
if i did n't put that floss in my pocket i 'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses .
yes i am .
what ? you do n't like this ?
what do you mean wednesday ? i though we had tickets to the knick game wednesday . we got seats behind the bench . what happened ? we 're not going ?

i do n't understand why you spend time with this guy .
no no no no you have to approach this as if he was a woman .
absolutely . you just tell him the truth .
she calls me up at my office
she says we have to talk . '
that or who 's bra is this ? '
so we order lunch and we 're talking . finally she blurts out how it 's not working .
so i 'm thinking as she 's saying this i 'm thinking great the relationship 's over . but the egg salado s on the way . so now i have a decision do i walk or do i eat ?
we sat there for twenty minutes chewing staring at each other in a defunct relationship .
have you ever had their egg salad ?
it 's unbelievable . you know what else is unbelievable ? i picked up the check . she did n't even offer . she ended it . the least she could do is send me off with a sandwich .
it 's my money . what should i do ? throw it out the window ? i know a guy who took his vacation on his change .
that 's funny . you 're a funny guy .
ewing 's hurt ? how long is he going to be out ?
geez .
i got scared there for a second . the knicks without ewing .

this is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza ?
you know you have to know how to do that . you ca n't have people shoving their arms into a six hundred degree oven .
oh well
my money 's all tied up in change right now .
trapezoid ?
i never heard him say anything really funny .
you would think that but either you 're born with a sense of humor or you 're not . it 's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the earth .
i do n't know . but he ai n't funny .

that 's exquisite . listen uh if it 's not too much trouble could you pass me that paper over there ?

did you ever meet my friend simons ?
he knows this guy wilkinson . he made a fortune in the stock market . now he 's got some new thing . you know there 's supposed to be a big merger . he was n't even supposed to say anything . you guys should think about doing this too .
i do n't know . but simons said that if i wanted to get involved that wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell . you want to do it ?
it 's called sendrax . they 've got some new kind of technique for televising opera .

all simons was able to find out is that he 's in the hospital .
of course he 's been in touch with him . he 's left two messages . he just has n't heard back yet that 's all .

i do n't know what ? eight thousand . it 's a hyundai . get out of here . i told you not to sell . simons made money wilkinson cleaned up .
he chose the cats ?
i told you those trips were relationship killers . too bad you ca n't get your buddy superman to fly around the earth at super speed and reverse time . you 'd get all the money back you could have avoided the whole trip to vermont
pst . wilkinson 's got a bite on a new one . petramco corp . out of uh springfield . i think . they 're about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher .
shhhhh . if you want to get in there 's very little time . sweetheart no no no . that ought to cover it . just a second . just a let me jus peek come on come on come on
she ca n't kill me right ?
people break up all the time .
it just did n't work out . what can i do ? i wanted to love her . i tried to love her . i could n't .
i kept looking at her face . i 'd go c 'mon love her . love her . '
oh i had no choice . she squeezed it out of me . she 'd tell me she loved me . all right at first i just look at her . i 'd go oh really ? or uh boy that 's that 's something . but eventually you have to come back with well i love you . you know you can only hold out for so long . '
and i did n't even ask her out . she asked me out first . she called me up . what was i supposed to do ? say no ? i ca n't do that to someone .

i had nothing to do wtih any of this . i met all her friends i did n't want to meet them . i kept trying to avoid it . i knew it would only get me in deeper . but they were everywhere . they kept popping up all over the place . this is nancy this is susan this is amy this is my cousin this is my brother this is my father it 's like i 'm in quicksand .
my back is killing me .

you know i 'd go from nods to nothing
i think you absolutely have to say something to this guy . confront him .
yes .
if i was a different person .
i 'm outta there . i did it . it 's over .
i told her . in the kitchen which was risky cause it 's near all the knives . i started with the word listen . '
i said listen marlene and then the next thing i know i 'm in the middle of it . and there 's this voice inside of me going you 're doing it . you 're doing it . and then she started to cry and i weakened a bit . i almost relented but the voice jerry the voice said keep going keep going . you 're almost out . it 's like i was making a prison break you know and i 'm heading for the wall and i trip and i twist my ankle and they throw the light on you you know . so somehow i get though the crying and i keep running . then the cursing started . she 's firing at me from the guard tower . son of a bang . son of a boom . i get to the top of the wall the front door . i opened it up i 'm one foot away i took one last look around the penitentiary and i jumped .

oh i was trying to make a point .
i think i swallowed a fly . i swallowed a fly . what do i do ? what can happen ? .
you know i 've been thinking . i cannot envision any circumstances in which i 'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again . how 's it going to happen ? i just do n't see how it could occur .
they always make me take stock of my life . and how i 've pretty much wasted all of it and how i plan to continue wasting it .
you know i ca n't believe you 're even considering not playing . we need you . you 're hitting everything .
who 's going to play left field ?
bender ? he ca n't play left . he stinks . i just do n't see what purpose is it going to serve your going ? i mean you think dead peole care who 's at their funeral ? they do n't even know they 're having a funeral . it 's not like she 's hanging out in the back going i ca n't believe jerry did n't show up . '
if you 're a spirit and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies and find out the mysteries of the universe you think she 's going to want to hang around drexler 's funeral home on ocean parkway ?
you know how easy it is for dead people to travel ? it 's not like getting on a bus . one second . it 's all mental .
who gets picked off in softball ? it 's unheard of .
and then in the fifth inning why did you take off on the pop fly ?
what about sharon besser ?
maybe manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day .

what are you bud abbott ? what are you calling me an idiot ?
oh schumann . of course .
really ? well what if it does n't stop ? oh that i really needed to hear . that helps a lot . all right just say something . just start talking . change the subject . let 's just go all right ? i ca n't believe we 're having dinner with alton benes .
yeah he 'll be looking at us like he 's backstage at a puppet show .
master of the housekeeper of the inn this is huge . when did this happen ?
can i say one thing to you ? and i say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality .
it 's fabulous .
and i 'll tell you something else i 'm not even going to ask you . i want to know . but i 'm not going to ask . you 'll tell me when you feel comfortable . so what was it ? four hundred ? five hundred ? did you pay five hundred for this ? over six ? ca n't be seven . do n't tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket . did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket ? is that what you 're saying to me ? you are sick . is that what you paid for this jacket ? over seven hundred ? what did you pay for this jacket ? . i wo n't say anything . i want to know what you paid for this jacket . oh my god . a thousand dollars ? . you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket ? . all right fine . i 'm walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket unless you tell me different . oh ho . all right . i 'll tell you what if you do n't say anything in the next five seconds i 'll know it was over a thousand .
well i 'm going with him . i 'd like to i 've never done a solid before .
master of the housequick to catch your eyenever wants a passerby to pass him by
maybe he did n't show up .
i do n't think there 's ever been an appointment in my life where i wanted the other guy to show up . wait a second is that him ?
i 'm nervous .
it 's a great thrill to meet you sir .
and i 'll have a club soda with no ice .
you like ice ?
i said do you like ice ?
do n't you think you get more without it ?
yeah yeah . she 's punctual and uh she 's been late sometimes .
i guess today she 's late .
yup .
i know i know that 's what they said .
the weather guy dr . waldo .
no of course not . i did n't
oh he 's the comedian .
no no . he 's just being modest .
i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoyed fair game . i thought it was just brilliant .
yea well maybe some parts .
the drivel parts . oh my gosh i just realized i have to make a phone call . i i ca n't believe would you
thank you for leaving me alone with him .
well let 's just leave .
where is she ?
how could she leave us alone with this lunatic ? ten more minutes and that 's it . i 'm leaving . i have to tell you this guy scares me .
if she does n't show up we ca n't possibly have dinner with him alone .
we 'll say we 're frightened and we have to go home .
i do n't know . just start scratching . tell him you have the crabs . he was in the military . he 'll understand that .
my uh uncle is having an operation . i just wanted to see how he was .
bone marrow .
sure guatamala
come on let 's go .
to hell with elaine .
we 're dying here .
he 's in the bathroom .
could n't be better .
get outta here
where do you come up with this stuff ?
master of the housedoling out the charmready with a handshake and an open
i would n't think so .
why do n't you just turn it inside out ?
it 's uh it 's only a few blocks .
so then as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there and she was sort of smiling at me and i was n't sure if she wanted me to ask her out because when women smile at me i do n't know what it means . sometimes i interpret it like they 're psychotic or something and i do n't know if i 'm supposed to smile back i do n't know what to do . so i just stood there like remember how quayle looked when benson gave him that kennedy line ? that 's what i looked like .
no i froze .
oh yeah . so wait wait . a half hour later i 'm back in the office i tell lloyd the whole story . he says so why do n't you call her ? i says i ca n't . i could n't i could n't do it right then . for me to ask a woman out i got to get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks . so lloyd calls me a wuss .
yeah . anyway he shamed me into it .
right . and and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone it makes you sound casual .
right . so i call her up i tell her it 's me she gives me an enthusiastic hi . '
oh i do n't get the enthusiastic hi i 'm outta there .
so we 're talking and i do n't like to go too long before i ask them out i want to get it over with right away so i just blurt out what are you doing saturday night ? '
she bought .
then i got off the phone right away .
it 's amazing . we we both have dates on the same night . i ca n't remember the last time that happened .
i ca n't stand doing laundry . that 's why i have forty pairs of underwear .
absolutely . because instead of doing a wash i just keep buying underwear . my goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair . that way i only have to do wash once a year .
yeah . we should do this again .
oh no thanks . i ca n't drink coffee late at night it keeps me up .
okay .
yeah take it easy .
take it easy . huh . take it easy .
she invites me up at twelve o'clock at night for coffee and i do n't go up . no thank you . i do n't want coffee . it keeps me up . too late for me to drink coffee . i said this to her . people this stupid should n't be allowed to live . i ca n't imagine what she must think of me .
she invited me up . coffee 's not coffee coffee is sex .
coffee 's coffee in the morning . it 's not coffee at twelve o'clock at night .
yeah people who work at norad who 're on twenty four hour missile watch . everything was going along so great . she was laughing i was funny i kept saying to myself keep it up do n't blow it you 're doing great . '
i ca n't call her now . it 's too soon . i 'm planning a wednesday call .
of course you do but you 're imagining a guy you like not a guy who goes oh no i do n't drink coffee late at night . if i call her now she 's going to think i 'm too needy . women do n't want to see need . they want a take charge guy a colonel a kaiser a tsar .
that 's exactly what i 'm trying to avoid .
yes she wants me to like her if she likes me . but she does n't like me .
all right i got to make a call . everybody out come on .
because i ca n't call a woman with other people in the room . come on let 's go .
yes .
right alright . oh jerry do you have any apples ?
um hi it 's george george costanza remember me ? the guy that did n't come up for coffee . you see i did n't realise that coffee did n't really mean well whatever . anyway it was fun . it was it was fun so oh boy um so you call me back . if you want . it 's up to you you know whatever you want to do . either way . the ball 's in your court . so uh take it easy .
got her machine . i 'm dead i 'm a dead man . that 's it . i 'm dead i 'm a dead man . dead man .
i do n't know what the hell i said . i gave her an ultimatum and there 's nothing i can do . it 's a machine . the little light is blinking right now come and listen to the idiot . hey everybody the idiot 's on . '
now i 'm in the worst position of all .
he did that ?
somebody did that ?
wait till you hear this . whoa ah i 'm sorry i did n't i had no idea .
i just wanted to talk to him for a minute but i 'll come back .
you sure ?
okay .
donna . oh you 're the one that likes that commercial .
no he he did n't actually tell me that uh we were talking about that commercial in fact i think i brought it up because i like that commercial . no he he would never tell me anything . he never discusses anything . he 's he 's like a clam . you 're not going to mention this to him
say ? what ? nothing i
why did you have to get me in trouble ?
boy oh boy .
hello . all right we should be going . come on
come on .

exactly but they 're on there waiting . she said she ca n't wait to see me we 're having dinner tonight . she 's supposed to call me as soon as she gets home .

yes i did .
what do you think i said ?
i told her the truth .

oh my god there she is . that 's the face just like the picture .
yeah . hi . it 's great to meet you .
no no . i just got here . a few minutes ago .
well why do n't you take off your hat and stay awhile .
that 's an interesting question .
how so ? i 'll tell you how so . she 's bald .
what do you think i mean bald ? bald . bald bald .
she 's bald .
oh come on ? no come on . she took off her hat and there she was hello . it was like i was looking at myself in the mirror .
let me tell you something . no one walks into a beauty parlor and says give me the larry fine . '
you fixed me up with a bald woman .
yeah that 's right .
so ?
no i 'm not . i was bald .
elaine .
no no no elaine .
nooooo .
i tell you when she threw that toupee out the window it was the best thing that ever happened to me . i feel like my old self again . totally inadequate completely insecure paranoid neurotic it 's a pleasure .
and you know what else i 've decided to do ? i 'm going to keep seeing the bald woman .
her scalp was clean . she had a nice skull . there just was n't a lot of hair on it .
going to need a little more coffee here .
i 'm sorry jerry i ca n't help you .
jerry i ca n't . it 's like saying to pavorotti teach me to sing like you . '
jerry just remember . it 's not a lie if you believe it .
do you ? that makes me so happy . elaine 's proud of me jerry .
i got rejected by a bald woman . a bald woman rejected me . heh you like that one ? a woman with no prospects and no hair told me that i was n't her type . apparently baldy likes a slimmer guy .
say it 's saturday night in spain . they go out dancing . you think they do the flamenco ?
so you could call a woman for a date ask her if she 's free for dinner and a flamenco ?
boy i wish the flamenco was popular here .
yes i think i would .
what for ?
so what no lunch ?
oh . how 's she doing ?
ah . you know there 's got to be an easier way to open ketchups . they should make it in a tube .
ya hah .
i 've seen squeeze mustard . i 've never seen squeeze ketchup .

oh there 's a difference . it 's subtle .

oh . okay .
oh thank you .
what ?
i still do n't see why i ca n't ask her about my arm .
why not ?
i love these people you ca n't ask em questions . they 're so mentally gifted that we must n't disturb the delicate genius unless it 's in the confines of an office . when huge sums of money are involved then the delicate genius can be disturbed .
people think they 're so important
what 're you getting ?
well just tell kramer to tell her .
you know my arm feels a lot better . that wendy really knows her stuff .
yeah same time . there you go .

oh i 'm sorry i require twenty four hours notice for a cancellation . now as i see it you owe me seventy five dollars .

i love this place . you know carl and i come here all the time .
check please .
mr . morgan . did you hear that ? mr . morgan .
take toilet paper for example . do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime ? it 's just paper on a cardboard roll that 's it . and in ten thousand years it will still be exactly the same because really what else can they do ?
and everything else has changed . but toilet paper is exactly the same and will be so until we 're dead .
it 's just paper on a roll that 's it . and that 's all it will ever be .
you find this interesting do n't you ?
something 's up there 's something in the air .
well i think this is it .
i saw siena again .
we discussed toilet paper .
yeah i told her how toilet paper has n't changed in my lifetime and probably would n't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated fascinated .
ok ok fine . it 's changed it 's not really the point . anyway i 'm thinking of making a big move .
i might tell her that i love her . i came this close last night then i just chickened out .
fifty fifty .
aw i 've just got to say it once everybody else gets to say it why ca n't i say it ?
once to a dog . he licked himself and left the room .
eh eh eh ca n't do it ca n't do it sorry i got a date .
oh no no no if you must know i would rather be with her than go to the game .
hey by the way if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo siena works there as a trainer .
yeah yeah .
you know i could have actually gone to that .
well i did n't want to break our date .
because i i love you .
yup .
huge matzoh ball .
well it 's all over . i slipped up .
you have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there 's an i love you out of the bag ? you ca n't have a relationship where one person says i love you' and the other says i 'm hungry . let 's get something to eat . .
i mean now she thinks that i 'm one of these guys that love her . nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them .
you want to be with somebody that does n't like you .
i am never saying i love you again unless they say it first .
that 'd be me .
wait a minute you were at a funeral right ?
well people never give a good hello at a funeral . i mean they go like this that 's the biggest .
hey they ca n't go hey . you look fabulous . '
girlfriend yeah right .
barry ?
what ?
oh my god .
she probably never heard it . do n't you see what this means ? it 's like the whole thing never happened . it 's like when superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save lois lane .
that 's the question jimmy .
i 'm going to do it .
i 'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it .
siena i love you .
yeah . just confirming .
thanks see you later donna .
what happened to you ?
what ? what did you do ?
what did you do ?
done what ?
elaine 's moving into your building ?
right above you ?
you 're going to be neighbors .
she 's right above you ?
how could you do that ?
do n't insult me my friend . remember who you 're talking to . no one 's a bigger idiot than me .
did you ever go to a singles weekend in the pocono 's ?
you 're doomed . you 're going to have to have all your sex at women 's apartments . it 'll be like a permanent road trip . forget about the home bed advantage .
of course . we all do .
i was just in there . it 's embarrassing .
they saw me walk out .
my censor quit two years ago . he checked into a clinic . emotionally exhausted .
tough .
i never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray .
for that rent she 'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to .
i 'd like to have a kid . of course you have to have a date first remember my friend adam from detroit ?
he 's a cube . anyway he got married six months ago . he told me ever since he 's been wearing a wedding band women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes .
i wonder if that 's really true .
thanks a lot . i 'll give it back to you in a week .
i 'm not doing that .
no i 'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you .
what happened to you ?
five thousand dollars ? she does n't have five thousand dollars .
so she ca n't get the apartment .
so she does n't move in .
and how does the baldness fit into that plan ?
are you kidding ? i lie every second of the day . my whole life is a sham .
of course you do .
yeah my wife could n't make it today . she 's got something with her mother who knows what 's going on with her . do n't let any one kid you it 's tough .
yeah my wife started getting on me about the lawn today . i 'm telling you it 's one thing after another .
uh no no she 's working .
she 's an etymologist . you know bees flies gnats . w what about you ?
but
i 'm sorry i do n't see the big deal about being a matador . the bull charges you move the cape what 's so hard ?
you 'd have to be a real loser to try something like that .
umm i 'm not . it 's just a sociological experiment .
is that right ? i just threw away a lifetime of guilt free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in madison square garden . so please a little respect . for i am costanza lord of the idiots .
but suddenly a new contender has emerged
where were you ?
well you know if you were sitting right next to her you 'd have to console her no matter what .
when you 're talking about a movie like beaches' moving from the chair to the couch . . . that 's quite a voyage .
hey . i got to go .
i did n't know you were such a bette midler fan .
gennice palying today ?
going backstage is the worst . especially when they stink . you know that 's a real problem .
yeah he once bumped into reverend yung sun moon .
i watched beaches on cable last night . give me a break .
aaaaaah
come on it 's just a game .
so what ? somebody dropped an egg on my head as i went into my building last night .
you heard him .
oh yeah . i read what you said to the papers yesterday . you were n't in on the planing . what planning ? you think we planed this ? uh ?
who are you to decide ?
hey look kramer
well you got no place to go . i 'll tell you what your problem is you brought your queen out too fast . what do you think ? she 's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house ? no the queen is old fashioned . . likes to stay home . cook . take care of her man . make sure he feels good .
i do n't think we should see each other any more .
i do n't see how i could perform sexually in a situation after something like that . i was completely emasculated . anyway it 's not the only reason .
all right . you want to know what one of her favorite expressions is ? happy pappy ?
like if she wants to know if i 'm pleased with something she 'll say happy pappy ? '
i 'm pappy .
oh come on . what are you kidding ? george i 'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs . anyway look who 's talking . you just broke up with with melanie last week because she shuushed you while you were watching tv .
what is this ? did you ever get the feeling like you 've had a haircut but you did n't have one ? i 'm all itchy back here .

it took a couple of hours of convincing . i was persistent . i was just like those guys in the movies . and it worked . she said yes' . i ca n't believe my luck that she was still available . a beautiful woman like that . you think she 's good looking right ?
yes . she 's got great skin a rosy glow

i got to go .
is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride to be . ]
i will never understand the bathrooms in this country . why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor ?
is n't that why we have locks on the doors ?
a backup system ? we 're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working ? that 's not a system . that 's a complete breakdown of the system .
why ? what 's wrong with the subject ? this is a bad subject ?
it 's not that i want to keep talking about it ? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum .
how am i going to do this ? i 'm engaged to this woman ? she does n't even like me . change the subject ? toilets were the subject . we do n't even share the same interests .
i want your honest opinion about something .
no you have n't . well maybe you have . what do i know .
all right . okay tell me what you think about this idea extend the doors on the toilet stalls at yankee stadium all the way to the floor .
it 's good right ?
you do ?
well i told it to susan before and she did n't like it .
yeah . not only that this is what she said to me can we change the subject ? '
right . i mean we 're on a subject . why does it have to be changed ?
that 's exactly what i said except i used the word momentum .
same thing . my god i 'm getting married in december do you know that ?
well i do n't see how i 'm going to make december . i mean i need a little more time . i mean look at me i 'm a nervous wreck . my stomach aches . my neck is killing me . i ca n't turn . look . look .

especially her . she does not like disappointment . well i have to do it . i ca n't make december . there 's no way i can make december . right ? i mean you can see that right ? i mean look at me . look . look . can i make december ? i ca n't make december . right ? look . look .

well i guess i 'm getting older .
yeah .
yeah . thanks . hey listen if you ever get a date maybe the four of us could go out together sometime .
wait as a matter of fact was n't there some guy in your building that you said you liked ? he lived up on the fifth floor or something .
yeah . boy she is something is n't she ?
nope . i wept like a baby .
well i started to tell her and then all of the sudden for some reason i just burst into tears .
i bawled uncontrollably . i just poured my guts out . and i 'll tell you jerry it was incredible . i never realized how powerful these tears are . i could have postponed it another five years if i wanted to .
wait . whoa . that 's the rabbi from elaine 's building . i just met this guy the other day .
and then i hear this rabbi on television i mean imagine .
ya know i was just a little surprised .
what about all the loser stuff ?
well scintillating as always .
i 'm going shopping with susan .
clothes shopping .
ross .
yeah it 's her uncle 's .
one would hope .
i do n't like it it 's red . it it 's too flashy .
all right . do n't change me . susan . do n't change me . ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now .
see now this i do n't get .
the security guard .
why does he have to stand ?
but i mean look at him . he 's got to be on his feet like that all day ? that 's brutal . i think i 'm going to say something to your uncle .
are n't you concerned about the security guard ?
she 's not concerned about the security guard . what kind of a person is this ? i 'm marrying a person who does n't care that this man has to stand here NUM hours a day when he could easily be sitting .
yeah . you like it .
why the color ?
too flashy ?
no .
let me ask you something . when you go into a store does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day ?
see did n't bother susan either . that 's why i 'm different . i can sense the slightest human suffering .
let me just say this . it is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet in one spot for eight hours a day . why should n't he have a chair ?
what he ca n't jump out of the chair ? how long does that take ? here look at this . here watch . criminals . boom . i 'm up . stop it . stop it . stop it .
would you get out of here . who 's going to turn down a chair ? i would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this . maybe i 'll have a talk with him .
who ?
i 'm going to need a coffee here . very hot . boiling .
tired ?
how come uh no chair ?
i i could n't help but notice that uh you do n't have a chair .
no i did n't mean to imply that you did . you 're obviously a very well proportioned individual . i was just wondering have they ever offered you a chair ?
would you like a chair ?
ah ha ah ha . you would would n't you ?
that 's exactly my point .
cause i tell you frankly i would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down . that would give me a lot of pleasure . call me crazy .
who ?
bob cobb ?
oh i missed the maestro ?
huh . your renting a house in tuscany ?
so what do you care ?
of course he is . there 's got to be houses for rent in tuscany . do you know how big tuscany is ?
it it 's huge . it 's probably like north dakota .
it 's a big region .
i do n't know why i bother even talking to you .
all right .
so i spoke to the security guard .
well it 's tough to get a good read but i think if i brought him a chair he 'd sit .
yup . it 's really just a question of what kind . thinking about a bar stool .
oh i think i 'd go for the back .
i suppose he could swivel . hey maybe one of those director 's chairs . what do you think of those .
you mean one of those vinyl things ?
vinyl yeah maybe .
yeah good luck . hey i 'll meet you outside .
what do you think about a rocking chair ?
what 's your name ?
i 'm engaged to mr . ross niece . i 'm probably going to be taking over this whole place someday so if i were you i would stay on my good side .
innocent mistake .
well here you go . what do you think ?
hey i 'm his nephew all right ? do n't worry about it . go ahead . check it out .
your wake up guy asked you out ?
now you 're off on a topic .
you see i disagree . i 'd rather be dating the blind . you know you could let the house go . you could let yourself go . a good looking blind woman does n't even know you 're not good enough for her .
ow ow you squirted me .

susan why ?
oh i do n't think you want to do that .

where did this come from all of a sudden ?
i really think i should have been consulted about this .
here something .
by the way have you spoken to elaine yet today ?
she called susan last night .
how do you know ?
your idea ?
wha 'd you do that for ?
well that was a really stupid thing . you know what 's going to happen now ?
whe well yeah .
yes . it blows up . if you knew that what did you tell elaine for ?
you could n't figure out the worldo s theory for yourself ? it 's just common sense . anybody knows ya got to keep your worlds apart .
hey .
he knows the worlds theory .
ha .
you know uh she has no female friends . you know that do n't cha ? something strange about a woman who 's friends are all men .
you talked all about that ?
did you just say vault ?
you got that from elaine .
well it 's a little strange . you going to start to talk like elaine from now on ?
we 'd all go to movie on friday ?
this is not good . worldo s are colliding . george is getting upset .
ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing . if she is allowed to infiltrate this world then george costanza as you know him ceases to exist . you see right now i have relationship george but there is also independent george . that 's the george you know the george you grew up with movie george coffee shop george liar george bawdy george .
me too . and he 's dying jerry . if relationship george walks through this door he will kill independent george . a george divided against itself cannot stand .
you 're killing independent george . you know that do n't you ?
you know what word susan used last night ? hnuh . vault . hu
she got that from you .
is she the only girl in the whole world ? why ca n't you get find your own girl ?
you see . you see . you see what i 'm talking about . it 's all just slipping away . and you 're letting it happen .
one two three four .

yeah the oceans really are getting very sudsy .
i 'd get tired of it .
mick jagger .
oh well i 'm sure you can reach her she 's a poet . what does a poet need an unlisted number for ?
what are you looking at me like that for ?
what are you talking about ?
i know but do n't say anything to anyone . he told me not to tell you .
well you know i was thinking about what you said before and you 're right i 've never really been a couple so if that 's the rule then i 'm going to go by the rule .
so you want to go home and make up officially ?
what for ?
oh ok yeah . where am i going to park here ?
me run in ? why do n't you run in ?
of course i do .
you know . you use the uh

o . k i think i know where we can get one .
elaine ? it 's me george . hey sorry to bother you so late . hey . how ya doin . uh did you get any of those sponges ?
well susan .
susan loves the sponge .
what ?
elaine let me just explain something to you . see this is not just a weekend routine i 'm on the verge of make up sex here . you know about make up sex ?
elaine can i just explain something to you very privately here ? susan and i have been together many many times now and just between you and me there 's really no big surprises here so make up sex is all that i have left .
really ? how 'd she do that ?
my susan ?
because jerry it 's a couple rule . we have to tell each other everything .
what ?
you 're cutting me off ? no no no jerry do n't cut me off .
c 'mon jerry please . it wo n't happen again .
hey a hit is a totally different story .
so lena was upset huh ?
what it did n't bother her ?
what ?
too good
i see what you mean .
where 's the depravity ?
thanks again for last night .
you know you 're nuts with these sponges . george is getting frustrated .
elaine and her sponges she 's got like a war chest full of them .
oh no no condoms are for single men . the day that we got engaged i said goodbye to the condom forever .
make up sex ? you have to have that right after the fight we 're way past that .
no no i hate the condom .
i can never get the package open in time .
it 's not that easy . it 's like beat the clock there 's a lot of pressure there .
i 'm trying dammit .
i tried to tear it from the side you ca n't get a good grip here . you got to do it like a bag of chips .
would you wait a second ? just wait ?
it 's too late .
well i can see that . what do you have to do that for ? who cares about your pants size ?
i 'd kill to be a NUM .
that condom killed me . why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open ?
you never run out do you ? where 's kramer ? everything 's finished here .
hey where 's you aids ribbon ?
that took awhile .
i 'd like to help but my neck
so how long has it been in the basement ?
what 's in it ?
i know someone who 'll do it . she 's good . she 's honest .
students ca n't clean . it 's anathema . they do n't like it .
wait a second . i ca n't believe this . let me see this .
let me just see it .
let me just see it for a second .
oh my god it 's exactly the same .
when i was ten years old my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment . exactly . and one day i grabbed it and i was using it as a microphone . i was singing macarthur park' and i got to the part about i 'll never have that recipe again and it slipped out of my hand and it broke . my parents looked at me like i smashed the ten commandments . to this day they bring it up . it was the single most damaging experience in my life aside from seeing my father naked .

well then then you really have something to think about because you know if there 's any doubt in your mind and and it does n't even have to be a big doubt you know even a tiny doubt a dot of a doubt and
because if there 's any doubt at all i i feel we should cultivate it .
yes you know . deal with it . we have to deal with the doubt susan the doubt . must be dealt with .
nooooooooooo
excuse me huh i think i made a big mistake . i 'd like my deposit back please .
you got hookers turning tricks in my car . how 's that for starters .
allright very good i 'd like my car and my deposit back please
whadday 'mean . ?
well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse ? cause i do n't remember reading that clause either

what are you talking about i want my car .
bear with you . this is a parking lot people are supposed to be able to get
that 's it . this is it . i 'm done . through . it 's over . i 'm gone . finished . over . i will never work for you again . look at you . you think you 're an important man ? is that what you think ? you are a laughingstock . you are a joke . these people are laughing at you . you 're nothing . you have no brains no ability nothing . i quit .
guess what .
kramer . guess what .
i quit my job .
i could n't take it anymore .
i go in to use his private bathroom everybody uses it and then i get a memo a memo telling me to use the men 's room in the hall . well i mean we share it with pace electronics . it 's disgusting .
i snapped . it was the last straw .
nobody 's hiring now . the market 's terrible .
i like sports . i could do something in sports .
you know like the general manager of a baseball team or something .
well it does n't even have to be the general manager . maybe i could be like an announcer . like a color man . you know how i always make those interesting comments during the game .
what about that ?
well that 's really not fair .
movies . i like to watch movies .
do they pay people to watch movies ?
that 's true .
right .
those unions . okay . sports movies . what about a talk show host ?
i think i 'd be good at that . i talk to people all the time . someone even told me once they thought i 'd be a good talk show host .
yeah . a couple of people . i do n't get that though . where do you start ?
you ca n't just walk into a building and say i want to be a talk show host .
it 's all politics .
this could have been a huge mistake .
guess not . what should i do ?
go back ?
you mean just walk into the staff meeting on monday morning like it never happened ?
just go back . pretend the whole thing never happened .
i was just blowing off a little steam . so what ?

come on . will you stop it .
teasing .
i do n't know where you 're getting this from . i you 're serious are n't you ? oh you see ? you see you just do n't know my sense of humor . dan do n't i joke around all the time ?
i 'll always be a winner and you 'll always be a loser . this is what he said to me .
no . that 's not that .
no .
i 've got some plans . i got plans .
what 's the difference ?
i 'm going to slip him a mickey .
you do n't understand . he 's got this big party coming up . he 's been looking forward to this for months . this is going to destroy the whole thing .
no . no . no . no . no . do n't worry . it 's perfectly safe . i researched it . he 'll get a little woozy . he might keel over .
this is what they would do in the movies . it 's a beautiful thing . it 's like a movie . i 'm going to slip him a mickey .
nah .
i got a source .
and elaine is going to keep him busy .
i told her what a sexist he is . how he cheats on his wife .
but she did n't know he does n't recycle .
revenge .
there 's no chance of that .
that 's him over there . the one that looks like a blowfish .
yeah . hey thanks for doing this .
this is by far the most exciting thing i 've ever done .
first time in my life i 've ever gotten back at someone .
that 's exactly what i told jerry .
yes . god i 've never felt so alive .
you go over there
you start flirting with him and i 'll come by and while you 're keeping him busy i 'll slip it in his drink .
glenda can i ask you a favor ? can i have this seat ?
i ca n't explain . it 's very important that i sit here .
okay . okay . fine .
i 'm going to count to three . if you do n't give up the chair the wig is coming off .
one
hello rick .
that 's right ricky boy it 's me .
oh .
boom .
oh .
you want me to come back ? uh
rick .
uh rick
rick .
drink up .
i like history . civil war . maybe i could be a professor or something .
i like horses . maybe i could be a stable boy .
nah . it 's probably a union thing .
i believe the doors on the bathroom stalls here at the stadium do n't offer much by way of privacy . but i was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors
it 's a calzone sir .
uh . cheese pepperoni eggplant .
you know a lost and found could be a good idea .
definitely .
there putting in a lost and found because of me . there 's a time limit but still .
yeah . i am like a drug dealer . i got the guy hooked . i am having lunch at his desk everyday this week . he does n't make a move without me . it 's very exciting .
so let me ask you a question about the tip jar . i had a little thing with the calzone guy this week . i go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as i am about to drop it in he looks the other way . and then when i am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing . i mean if they do n't notice it what 's the point .
not bills .
beautiful women . you know they could get away with murder . you never she any of them lift anything over three pounds . they get whatever they want whenever they want it . you ca n't stop them .
without thousands of fleeing japanese .
you know my last name is costanza . that 's italian . so you and i are like country men . pisano 's .
and i always take care of my pisano 's . so here is a little something .
no no . that 's not what i was trying to do .
i got your calzones mr . steinbrenner .
i thought tomorrow maybe we 'd try a little corn beef .
how about chinese ?
i just thought it would be nice . a little variety .
yeah .
well this is bad . i am really in a bad situation now .
what 's he going to do ? that 's exactly the point . nobody knows what this guy is capable of . he fires people like it is a bodily function .
because before you know it he 'll be having lunch with him . you know how these interoffice politics work .
what the hell is this ?
there has got to be some way to get back into pisano 's .
yeah . you 've heard of it ?
i 'll see you guys later .
yeah . and since you go buy there everyday . i was hoping that we could help each other out .
are you going to help me or not ?
what ?
all right .
that 's a little steep do n't you think ?
all right all right .
but i have to have them by one o'clock . he 's very regiment about his meals .
well i was dropping of the calzone money for the week um should n't you be at work by now ?
soooooo
you do n't work in the rain ? your a mailman . 'neither rain nor sleet nor snow it 's the first one .
you were supposed to deliver my calzones . we had a deal .
but i 'm paying you .
newman .
kramer .
look i need you to do me a favor . i need you to get me lunch at pisano 's .
he called in sick .
can you do it ?
NUM NUM p . m . do you need any money ?
what happened ? where have you been ?
what the hell happened to your shirt ?
your clothes smell just like pisano 's . there 's another italian place on jerome . maybe i can fool him .
because they were heated up there .
sorry the players will be reimbursed ?
sorry mr wilhelm .
i know sir . it wo n't happen again .
yes sir .
i will sir . top priority .
top priority .
so he walks out of the stall he 's been talking the whole time .
lbj ?
no kidding ?
well i still do n't know what i 'm supposed to do . i do n't even know what my assignment is .
i ca n't . he 's been on my case about not paying attention . besides it 's too late i already told him i heard him .
yeah follow up question that 'll work .
hey .
where 'd you go ?
why did n't you take your car ?
awright listen can you uh gimme a lift back to my place ?
awright i 'll see you later .
uh mr wilhelm .
hi i was just uh i just had one little question about uh my assignment .
yes yes . very smooth super smooth . no but i really want to attack this thing you know . sink my teeth into it . so i was just wondering what do you think would be the very best way to get started ?
well i was wondering
payroll ? no no i have n't done that .
payroll .
hello there . i 'm george costanza .
assistant to the travelling secretary . i 'm uh working on the project .
payroll project . wilhelm ? big uh big payroll project .
you know what i 'll just uh i 'll just look around for a little while . i 'll just browse around .
look i am under direct orders from mr wilhelm . so if you have a problem with that maybe you should just take it up with him .
you know what i urge you to take it up with him . go ahead give him a call he 'll tell you what i 'm doing here . then you can tell me .
so he explained it all to you ?
what 'd he tell you ?
yes payroll . yes i did . very productive . payroll paid off .
oh yeah . downtown . definitely .
yeah you said it . uh excuse me mr wilhelm . uh do you really think well is this downtown trip really necessary you know for the project ?
the song ?
downtown .
yeah .
i think he was trying to tell me something like it had some sort of a meaning .
when you 're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go
maybe you know some little places to go where they never close
wait a second . little places to go where they never close . what 's a little place that never closes ?
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city . linger on the sidewalk where the neon lights are pretty . where the neon lights are pretty . the broadway area ?
the lights are much brighter there . you can forget all your troubles forget all your cares just go
things 'll be great when you 're
i got nothing jerry . nothing .
you think i should come clean ? what do you think you think i should confess ?
uh mr wilhelm . uh about the project
i did ?
maybe somebody did it and did n't take credit for it . maybe it was already done and did n't need doing in the first place . i have no idea who did it what they did or how they did it so well . and you know what ? jimmy crack corn and i do n't care .
the point is however it got done it 's done . so any luck with the car ?
why not ?
hey .
i got to go .
you wanted to see me sir ?
yes sir .

i ca n't go .
you want me to find a poem about susan ? may she rest in peace ? .

jerry a throat clear is a non verbal implication of doubt he thinks i killed susan .
what time is it ?
right now ?
oh the bookstore girl . how 's that goin ?
where 's elaine ?
what 's with all these people having babies ?
yeah . right .

briefcase .
lemme tell you something that jerry lewis ? you wonder how some of these people get to the top ? it 's ideas like this . brilliant . hah hah . look at this what the hell happened ? the whole side is damaged here and the lock is broken .
five minutes . what the hell happened here ?
i have to rewind it first . alright alright .
stopped dead .
i do n't know .
kinda busy here .
why ca n't i stay ?
well if it does n't concern me then i can stay .
yes . yes i heard the squink' .
it 's baffling is n't it ?
they would never tell me elaine . first of all they probably think that i killed susan . besides i do n't even think they like me .
and you really believe this guy does n't want to have kids .
elaine i once told a woman that i coined the phrase pardon my french . '
i once told a woman that i really enjoy spending time with my family .
this is a crude mock up of the conference room . NUM scale .
yesterday took the day off . now from the time i left the room
yeah .
alright whatever . now . whatever caused the damage was jarring enough to completely stop the tape .
okay . that 's what we know .
well yeah .
i do n't know if you 're ready for it .
i believe that i am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation the likes of which you have never
i 'm not through here jerry . i 'm going to keep on investigating . this thing is like an onion . the more layers you peel the more it stinks .
there are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again . there are people in this room who think they can destroy other people 's property and get away with it . well let me tell you something about those people . they were n't counting on this brain . and this tape recorder .
you 'll have your turn . the truth must be heard . that 's all there was . and yet it speaks volumes . a low rumple . a metallic squink . a glonk . someone crying out dear god . let 's start with uh with you wyck .
alright then . we 've gotten to the bottom of that .
he embibed her glistening spell just before the other shoe fell .
no it 's a newman . well i got to run .
fine .
i got to go zoo . i feel like i could set more of my own schedule .
i 'm wearing a little hat i 'm jumping through fire they 're putting their little alien heads in my mouth

what ? i i did n't hear about that .
so concerned was he that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola ?

i have tell you i 'm pretty impressed with the first one .
no you see ? you got greedy .
i know less about women than anyone in the world . but one thing i do know is they 're not happy if you do n't spend the night . it could be a hot sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide you 're not going anywhere .
i hope i am .
what about jewelry ? that 's very nice gift .
maybe i 'll get her some jewelry .
what am i supposed to get a bazooka ?

who puts a bench in their house ?
i got it . you want to get her something nice ? how bout a music box ?
okay what about a nice frame ? with a picture of another guy in it . frame says i care for you but if you want to get serious perhaps you 'd be interested in someone like this .
what about candle holders ?
lingerie ?
waffle maker .
bust of nelson rockefeller .
let 's work on the card .
those birthdays . i told you . they 're relationship killers . if a relationship is having any problems whatsoever a birthday will always bring it out .
what is it about sex that just disrupts everything ? is it the touching ? is it the nudity ?
you know what this means ? i ca n't see her anymore either .
it 's break up by association . besides she 's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present .
NUM dollars .
so what 're you going to do ?
so maybe this should be it .
she seems like an it .
we 'd have to kill him .
i 'd go to prison as your accomplice . i 'd have to wear that really heavy denim . go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate . go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people .
you better call her .
so ?
you said you grabbed it outta there real fast right ?
so i 'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on you had already grabbed it out .
was she mad ?
you did n't tell her .
finicky ? prissy ? fastidious ?
ahh steinbrenner gave em to us in honour of phil rizzuto being inducted into the hall of fame .

no stings the throat . anyway so i was coming along here and i felt like a piece of cake you know ? but then i thought it 's morning i should really have a muffin . i like those chocolate chip ones . then i figured well they 're really both cake . so i uh i sat on that bench for a little while twenty minutes or an hour and then i figured check and see what you were up to . wait a minute wait a minute . the broad jump . the broad jump over the pothole on eighty sixth street .
now i remember as i jumped over the hole i heard a like a jingling sound .
i was trying to stick the landing . was right around here .
no . no .

what happened to the screen door ? it blew off again ?
why does she want you to be mad ?
so what do you care what she thinks .
she probably gets that impression because you 're cool . you 're under control . like me . nothing wrong with that .
not really . your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch .
i told ya . hey any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father 's screen door in queens ?
really ? you want to come ?
dad the hinges are all rusted here . that 's why the wind keeps blowing the door off .
dad what 's all this ?
you 're selling computers ?

wow . i did n't try that til i was NUM .
all right relax tough guy . i got to go out to my father 's garage help him sell some computers .

i 'll tell you what 's insane the price that i could get you on a new desktop computer .
there 's porn .
damn it .
jerry i 've found a way to beat lloyd braun . i buy the computers myself i store em in your apartment . then after i win the contest i bring em all back and get my money back . ha ha . it 's brilliant . what ? what 's wrong with your leg ?
i 'll store these over at kramer 's apartment .

what do you know ? you were in the nut house .
i heard they found a family in your freezer
jerry . i did it . haha . i beat braun .
come on want to give me a hand with the computers ?
why could n't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out ? why did you have to destroy twenty five computers ?
oh please do n't tell me you love me again jerry i ca n't handle it .
all right here goes
so that 's it . all of my darkest fears and everything i 'm capable of . that 's me .
where you going ? i i thought i could count on you for a little compassion .
i love you jerry .
you know all these years i 've always wanted to see the two of you get back together .
well what about all the lloyd braun sales ?
dad you really should lay off the serenity now stuff .
hoochie mama ?
she 's pregnant ? leslie is pregnant ? . oh see there is no justice .
yeah performance artist . she 's a real performer . a real trooper .
that woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life .
what you do n't think i can attract beautiful intelligent women ?
maybe for her new performance piece she 'll give birth on stage .
oh what a huge blow to the culture .
she dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in brooklin to see one of her performances .
god . she 's cooking dinner for god . she 's yelling and screaming and the next thing i know she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt .
oh yeah sure accident right . she was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire . then for the rest of the show i 'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt . flies are landing on me . i 'm boiling i 'm fantasizing all the things i 'm going to say when i see her . and later finally backstage when i talk to her i 'm a groveling worm . what kind of chocolate was that ? do you throw any other foods ? '
and then then then she leaves with somebody else . never even never even said goodbye . never called me back never apologized . nothing . like i was dirt .
i still have it . the collar 's okay . i wear it under sweaters .
let maria shriver give her a baby shower .
ich bin ein sucker .
she does n't deserve a baby shower . she deserves a baby monsoon . she deserves rosemary 's baby .
never said goodbye . never apologized . nothing .
never said goodbye . goodbye .
someday before i die mark my words i 'm going to tell that woman exactly what i think of her . i 'll never be able to forgive myself until i do .
i still wo n't be able to forgive myself but at least it wo n't be about this .
sounds like a rough trip .
so the college cancelled the gig ?
forget it .
it 's nothing .
ulterior motive .
what tonight ? now ?
my place ? no no no . i hate my place . i do n't want to go back to my place .
yeah i would . it 's just you know i just ate a whole pot roast .
should n't we at least drop off your bag ?
what are you talking about ?
i am ? what a strange coincidence
you got to let me go over there .
no i 'm going to hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale bosco that i had to live with for three years and i 'm going to say remember this shirt baby ? . well now it 's payback time . '
what am i going to say ? .
what did you go out with me for ? . just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether ? . i do n't deserve that kind of treatment . what you do n't have the common courtesy to return my calls ? . to apologize . you think i 'm some sort of a loser that likes to be abused and ignored ? . who 's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution ? . some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated ? you think you can avoid me like i have some sort of disease ? . you have the disease . you have the disease . you may be beautiful and rich and physically just unbelievable but you sicken me . you disgust me . you and everyone like you .
watch me .
about what ?
leslie .
george george costanza .
you i guess you do n't remember me but we actually kind of um went out a couple of years ago once remember ?
you took me to one of your shows
and um it was quite good . in fact you even incorporated me into the show . i 'm not actually a performer . although my parents felt i had talent
actually i never had any formal training . i guess i 'd be better suited for improvs or something
i 'll be right back .
every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life . and yet i want them all is that irony ?
what are you doing ?
oh yes by no means the mood . let me know if there 's anything i can do to lend support to the mood .
um cream soda ?
i was i had to leave . she lit some vanilla incenses . the smell drove me nuts all i could think about was food i had to get out of there . we need some pudding here . pudding .
i told i had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour .
i do n't know i was starving jerry .
oh pudding . you want some ?
what are you kidding ? we look great . you know what this pudding needs ? the skin on the top you know like your mother used to make it on the stove .
so eh what do you say ?
ok we got your got your strawberries your chocolate sauce your pastrami on rye with mustard your honey
oh yeah yeah do n't you know they used pastrami in that movie NUM ? weeks ? remember the pastrami scene ?
well maybe it was ghostbusters ? where ever it was it worked .
no .
she tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce but eh it 's not a meal you know ? food and sex those are my two passions . it 's only natural to combine them .
jerry i 'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl . she 's integral .
hey speaking of which i found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges exacto knife .
well i guess these would be out of the question .
pudding skin singles .
oh tara .
three pints of kramer 's blood ?
well so much for purification week .
doing quite well thank you . yesterday i had a soft boiled egg and a quickie . you know what ? if i could add tv to the equation that would really be the ultimate .
she 's right i heard kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby sitting gig .
oohoho spicy mustard woohoho you 're hot tonight .
and now for the trifecta .
pleasuring you ?
i got greedy . flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami .
i do n't know . this sandwich is making me flush .
i think you 're right . you going to eat that ?
these fries are really really good

yes they did . i was covering . elaine has been deported back to scotland .
all right no more lies . elaine is been chosen to represent the upper west side in the next biosphere project .

that 's perfect . he 's a zoo guy . he take 's care of animals . c can i bring the squirrel by ?
i got to get to fowler . i know that he would take this squirrel off my hands . it 's practically bionic .

hey shut up .
and on your dates .
well at the yankees it was all about smoothing things over you know chiseling away grinding down . in fact we used to call it the grind .
that should be NUM let me just
you wo n't regret this sir .
summer of NUM i 'm at the beach . this family sits up next to me . i go in to the surfs and when i come from out my clothes my towel my umbrella they 're all gone . i am furious i start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally i lose it i grab their boom box and i chuck it in to the ocean .
then i see my clothes floating out there . the tied took them out not the kids .
so now the father is screaming at me he 's demanding that i pay for the boom box . finally i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there .
until that stupid photo jogs his memory .
yeah .
it is a horrible company . there 's no management what so ever . i could go hog wild in there .
like retouched .
oh this is good . this kruger guy is clueless . i ca n't wait to work for him .
what did you do here ? you took out the wrong guy .
well i 'm still here . you took out the other guy .
i am aware .
i just pray kruger does n't realize that it 's gone until this guy can fix it up .
when are you going on your next date with her ?
what you 're going to pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place ?
this good be so sweet jerry . saving lives ? she 's one step away working at the clinique counter .
of course not . wash it dry it move on .
no no no no no this has to be carefully orchestrated . you go to a fancy dinner flowers
yeah you got to do it classy
almost . could n't get the girl go out with me the second time .
what is this ? this is a drawing .
this is a cartoon .
but it 's not a photograph i need a photograph .
i know . the only way to fix it now is to get a whole new photo of kruger .
without his shirt on .
it seemed so disorganized .
what about the coast guard ? seems like a lot of pride there a lot of tradition .
i think .
maybe i could be a land guy .
someone 's have to unhook the boat before it leaves the place .
i forgot to ask you how did the revenge date go ?
did you dressed nice did you do it classy ?
yeah you did you classed it up .
oh so it backfired ?
so i guess i was lucky that i never tried that myself .
wait a minute she did a skin cancer screening at peterman ?
could she do that at kruger ?
so i set up a screening everyone takes their shirt off and click i snap me a shot of a bear chested kruger .
jerry you got to talk to sitarides .
and that was wrong jerry . you simple must to apologize
yes . because it is the mature adult thing to do .
i just talked to mr . kruger he 'll be down in a minute . he wanted me to take a photograph for the record .
his personal file i i do n't ask
jerry what are you doing
dr . sitarides do n't go . oh thanks jerry .
aah yeah yeah . wo n't you head on in we 'll be in in a second . be right with you .
kramer this is perfect . i need you to go in there pretend you 're a doctor and check this guy for moles .
and get a picture of him with his shirt off .
alright lets get in there . quick quick quick
kramer i really owe you one .
what ?
so tell him you 're concerned about it and he should see someone else .
because you 're not a dermatologist .
whoa whoa a section ? .
no you 're not taking a deli slicer to my boss
no . absolutely not .
yep and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk no thanks to you .
why do n't you see someone about it ?
you 're not a doctor . you should n't even have books like this .
you ca n't tell him the truth you 're going to blow the whole thing .
i 'll get him to see a real doctor . you just stay away from this .
eh listen mr . kruger i got a message from dr . van nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole .
well he said it could be cancer maybe you should get it checked out .
whatever .
well that pear shaped loser was me . and i was in that photo until i broke in here stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there .
that 's what they tell me .
he said he did n't care . oh god i love that place . hey have you seen other dermatologist ?
what did he give you for it .
have to give him time on this hour .
so elaine are you going to sleep with me or what ? .

stanky hanke ? what did he want ?
ho ho ho ho . i ca n't wait for hanke to come crawling back to me .
still upset . very upset .
remember that new year 's party he threw a few years ago ? he had that very drafty apartment you know i think on ninth avenue .
i asked if i could borrow a sweater .
i said preferably cashmere for warmth . so in front of the whole party he says no . i do n't want you stretching out the neck hole . '
oh yeah sure laugh it up . everybody else did .
regardless . i had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap metlife windbreaker . now it is payback time .
it 's my head .
so she coughed .
everything goes with naked .
oh you spoiled spoiled man . do you now how much mental energy i expend just trying to picture women naked ?
all right . it 's grovel time .
what are you up to now uh step nine ?
important step . maybe the most important .
well hanke 's moved on to step ten . he was spotted taking personal inventory .
all he has to do now is count his blessings say a prayer and he 's done . do you believe this ?
oh hello hanke others .
you know jason i uh i could n't help notice i i did n't get my apology .
a drafty apartment ? a sweaterless friend ? a ball game giveaway metlife windbreaker ?
yeah the neck hole thing and i would appreciate it if you would say you 're sorry .
you 're an alcoholic . you have to apologize . step nine . step nine .
jerry i felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch . he was riffing . riffing . on my pain .
that 's right . i 'm two in the hole .
did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked ?
well what if you showed up bad naked huh ? you still got that belt sander ?
well you on all fours that thing vibratin' kicking up sawdust ho ho . she 'll get the picture .
so you 're jason hanke 's supervisor ?
whatever . listen i 'm very concerned about this guy .
yeah well when you do n't actually do the steps you can go through them pretty quick . you can get through six a day .
i do n't know . a little thing called step nine ? instead of an apology he was bebopping and scatting all over me .
well are n't you the boss of him ? you should n't let him move up . when i was in the cub scouts i got stuck on weebolos for three years cause i kept losing the pinewood derby .
well i think you should drop him down to step two .
yeah let him chew on that for a while .
all right . that 's more like it . thank you very much . by the way my uncle was an alcoholic so
where 's hanke ?
what ? rate aholics ?
hey i am not here for rage . i 'm here for revenge .
excuse me . am i talking to you pinhead ? am i ? .
i 'm losing it .
probably because this whole universe is against me .
i know . and now they want me to bottle it up . it makes me so mad .
this bread has nuts in it .
why not ? it 's a good look for a woman .
well some women like it .
well i 'm here . what is it ?
well thank you .
uh excuse me uh um jason . i do n't want to get into a big thing here but i 'm not sure if technically what you just said was actually an apology .
well it 's just all you said was your welcome' which is nice . it 's very nice . but i feel i got to get the apology .
i would like an apology .
baah . there it is . you just said it . that 's what i want . now say it again and tell it to me .
excuse me . is this uh rage aholics ?
thanks . what are you guys doing here ?
right .
step skipper . that man is a step skipper . he skips step nine .
that 's right . he never apologized to me for saying that i would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater .
it was n't funny .
he 's bebopping and scattin' and i 'm losing it .
oh yeah . still in good with the ground crew .
i 'm going to get some more of these kosher cocktail franks

i 've been doing a lot of thinking . this might be my chance to start giving something back .
i 'm serious .
i think i could be a philanthropist . a kick ass philanthropist . i would have all this money and people would love me . then they would come to me and beg . and if i felt like it i would help them out . and then they would owe me big time . first thing i 'm going to need is a driver
well there could be .
well i i could uh i could give the money back . here .
well sir i i gave out the fake card because um i do n't really celebrate christmas . i um i celebrate festivus .
festivus sir . and uh i was afraid that i would be persecuted for my beliefs . they drove my family out of bayside sir .
oh no sir . festivus is all too real . and i could prove it if i had to .
happy festivus .

oh please somebody stop this .
oh come on . be sensible .
ow . ow . i give i give . uncle .
when are they going to have the flying cars already ?
years . when we were kids they made it seem like it was right around the corner .
no . that 's just electric .
what 's the competition chitty chitty bang bang ?
the government is very touchy about us being in the air . let us run around on the ground as much as we want . anything in the air is a big production .
and the underwater bubble cities ?
shhh what is wrong with you ? you never tell em you like the car . you 're not sure what you want . you do n't even know why you 're here .
i 'm starving . we should have had lunch first
since when is elaine 's boyfriend selling cars ? i thought he was a mechanic .
there 's an easy move go from screwing you behind your back to screwing you right to your face .
puddy 's just going to give you the car huh ? you 'll see . first they stick you with the undercoating rust proofing dealer prep . suddenly you 're on your back like a turtle .
my father had a car salesman buddy . he was going to fix him up real nice . next thing i know i 'm getting dropped of in a le car with a fabric sunroof . all the kids are shouting at me hey le george . bonjour le george . let 's stuff le george in le locker .
look at these salesmen . the only thing these guys fear is the walk out . no matter what they say you say i 'll walk out of here right now .
hold it . one more step and we 're walkin' .
he is . you do n't know what i 'm doing here .
yeah you show us the NUM .
i 'm starving . you got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up ?
all right remember no rust proofing . commit to nothing . if you have to speak mumble .
do n't think it ca n't happen .
hey hey hey . what 's going on here ? you did n't agree to anything did ya ?
well i got screwed on the donuts . there were none left . heh .
hey gimme a dollar .
i 'm here helping you .
heh heh heh . that 's what they want you to think .
twix b NUM .
ah come on .
ah excuse me . do you have uh change of a dollar ?
could i uh could i trade you for another dollar ?
ah excuse me . when your uh when your wallet was open i i glanced inside and i could n't help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills .
perhaps you could look again please ? i 'm very hungry .
i guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie huh ? . you 're all doing a hell of a job . ho ho . what i would do with you
people can drop change down here jerry . and they 're too lazy to pick it up .
the cashier is at lunch which is where i 'd like to be .
i think something bit me . i just need another nickel .
ho ho ho . he 's got a live one . he 's just reeling his big fish in .
it 's wrinkled . it 's worthless .
ha ha ha ha . come on . jump .
they did ?
as you will see the candy bar is paid for and yet remains dangling in the machine . hey it 's gone . where is my twix ? what ? . that guy 's eating it .
uh it was dangling . there were only two left in the machine . he must 've bought one and gotten both .
no . hey . hey . i see you . that is my twix . oh ha ha . ho ho .
excuse me . i believe you just ate my twix bar . it was dangling . and when you purchased your twix bar you got a little freebie and you never bothered to ask why or seek out its rightful owner .
huh . you must think i 'm pretty stupid . that was no NUM avenue bar . i can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip . now that that that is a cookie and we all know that twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch .
nougat ? please . i think i 've reached the point in my life where i can tell the difference between nougat and cookie . so let 's not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications .
i know about the vein . i ca n't believe this guy
hey starving .
i tried to tell you but you would n't listen . no ho ho . you were going to get a deal huh ? there 's no laws in this place . anything goes . it 's thunderdome .
stay back .
all right puddy listen and listen good i need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here . big guy a liar . short name . sam ? moe ? sol ? .
i 'm starving . i can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine .
yes . this is wrong .
just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
does not imply transfer of ownership . moe sol or lem is not going to get away with this .
yes i 'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics .
yeah right i 'm going to get my car repaired at a dealership . huh . why do n't i just flush my money down the toilet ?
one of your guys kip or ned short name stole my twix candy bar .
he might as well have . i caught him and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs .
oh it was . but he claimed it was a NUM avenue bar .
oh no no . twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch .
no . rice and caramel .
no .
please .
all i want is my seventy five cents back an apology and for him to be fired .
they all have swirling chocolate in the commercial .
all right do you mind ? i have the window . now what are you going to do about my twix ?
no . there 's no coconut .
now if this mechanic guy was in fact eating a NUM avenue bar as he claims would n't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line up ?
i 've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from .
only i hold the answer key to their true candy identities . and so without further ado i give you the candy line up .
that 's my candy line up . where are all my cards ? . they 're they 're all on the floor .
and you . how many twix does that make for you today ? . like NUM twix ? .
it 's a twix . they 're all twix . it was a setup . a setup i tell ya . and you 've robbed it . you 've all screwed me again . now gimme one . gimme a twix .
twwwwiiiiiixxxxx .
this arby 's is good .
i do n't know . all of em . they 're all crooks . besides i could n't get all different candy bars anyway .
what was that ?
and this is the first you 're seeing of the coat ?
an apartment warming gift ? we got to give presents to people for moving ? birthdays christmas it 's enough gifts . i would like one month off .
all right but we 're not buying it at bloomingdale 's . i will buy it you pay me back later . i 'll sniff out a deal . i have a sixth sense .
hey look at this . this is the same massage chair we 're getting for joe mayo $NUM cheaper .
i 'll have em overnight it .
it does n't matter if it 's more comfortable . it 's wrong .
because important things go in a case . you got a skull for your brain a plastic sleeve for your comb and a wallet for your money .
i need everything in there .
i might go there .
all right just gimme that . and gimme some of those sweet & lows .
a man carries a wallet .
love to .
no i do n't have it yet .
no i brought a picture of the chair .
i thought we 'd all sign the picture .

and you threw it out the window ?
god you 're like a rock star .
well i 'm satisfied . uh my back is killing me .
this is an organizer a secretary and a friend .

excuse me ?
oh i ca n't believe you 're dropping out too . so now kramer and i have to pay for the entire gift ?
he 's the guy we 're the buying the chair for remember ? it was your suggestion .
oh so now i have to buy this whole chair by myself ?
i already bought it . i 've been lying to you for three days and now you 're all screwing me .
i needed it . my back is a little tweaked .
never . it is a part of me . i will just return the chair and it will be easy because the receipt is in my good friend .
well at least i 'm not carrying a purse .
learn guitar first lesson free ? huh .

hey .

no never mind .
maybe it 's got something to do with that NUM in the corner .

what 's the decision ?
silence yes .
shut up shut up shut up
my friends are idiots she does n't look like jerry . she does n't look like anybody . and so what if does look like jerry what does that mean ? . that i could have everything i have with jerry but because it 's a woman i could also have sex with her and that somehow that would be exactly what i always wanted she does n't even look like jerry
i know
you know you know what 's great about our relationship ? it 's not about looks .
no ca n't be for instance i remember when we first met we had a great conversation .
but after that we really talked did n't we ?
na no this relationship he he has got to be about something and fast or i 'm in very serious and weird trouble hum what else happened ?
aw right yes . gum . good enough i 'll take it .
i do too . you see that 's what we 're about . you do n't remind me of anyone and we love gum .
i 'm losing it
ok look the gum is n't cutting it for me . we need to be about something else anything please .
your hair ?
george is in big trouble
like that
that .
yes
nooo
exactly
we must never ever speak of this again
actually i think i 'm going to take a few days off
cops . i do n't even care about cops . i want to see more garbage men . it 's much more important . all i want to see are garbage trucks garbage cans and garbage men . you 're never going to stop crime we should at least be clean .
i think this is him right here .
i do n't know i have to call her tell her where we are . i 'm very lucky she 's even considering seeing me at all .
they were it 's kinda complicated .
what do you want to do ?
i got to call tatiana . where 's the phone ?
excuse me are you going to be very long ?
you know it 's a public phone you 're not supposed to just chit chat .
he knows i 'm waiting . he sees me . he just does n't want to look .
i just ca n't believe at the way people are . what is it with humanity ? what kind of a world do we live in ?
excuse me are you going to be much longer ? i have to make a very important call .
hey .
if anything happens here can i count on you ?
if we decide to go at it .
i have to get in touch with tatiana . and look at his little outfit . it 's all so coordinated the way his socks matching to his shirt . i really hate this guy .
i do n't know her .
what are they going to do ?
for NUM bucks ? i 'd put my face in the soup and blow .
what were you doing ?
alleluia .
excuse me i was waiting here .
i 've been standing here for the last ten minutes .
that 's not the point . the point is i was here first .
you know we 're living in a society . we 're supposed to act in a civilized way .
does she care ? no . does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual ? no . no . a resounding no .
oh that 's ok really do n't worry about it .
yeah well he probably bought it .
i should n't even tell you this .
well after dinner last week she invites me back to her apartment .
well it 's this little place with this little bathroom . it 's like right there you know it 's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove . you understand ? there 's no buffer zone . so we start to fool around and it 's the first time and it 's early in the going . and i begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm . so i know i 'm going to have to stop . and as this is happening i 'm thinking even if i can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force i know that that bathroom is not going to provide me with the privacy that i know i 'm going to need
so i finally stop and say tatiana i hope you do n't take this the wrong way but i think it would be best if i left .
no . during .
yeah .
so i 'm dressing and she 's staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events . i do n't know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all i do n't have the time to say it . the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman and i 'm very sorry i just saw the bat signal . it took me NUM days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again . now she 's waiting for me to call her and she 's
she 's off .
she 's not there . she left . she must 've waited and left because those people would n't get off the phone .
yeah i told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding stocky man with glasses . i better tell him i 'm expecting a call .
NUM bucks ? is n't that excessive ?
it 's more than the meal .
alright . NUM NUM NUM . i 'm not going to eat that much .
oh no i ca n't do it . i i 'm not good at these things i get flustered . once i tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby i almost got arrested .
you did n't make it clear .
so ?
we should have left earlier . i told you .
i ca n't go anywhere i have to wait here for tatiana 's call . let me just check .
excuse me i 'm expecting a call . costanza ?
well was it for costanza or
well was it a woman ?
she called . he yelled cartwright . i missed her .
i 'm cartwright .
of course i 'm not cartwright . look why do n't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves i 'm not in the mood .
should we tell him we 're leaving ?
maura i uh i want you to know i i 've given this a lot of thought . i 'm sorry but we uh we have to break up .
what 's that ?
w we 're not ?
all right
she said no .
what could i do ? . we fooled around and went to a movie .
well i do n't really like her .
i do n't find her attractive .
i 'd like to sleep with a lot of other women .
sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food ooh mr . mashed potatoes you are sooo goood . '
and in bed
what ?
i got some cufflinks i couldo ve loaned you .
you already have an in . you have the same first name . jerry' .
well it worked when i met george peppard last week .
well whoever he was he knew a lot about the a team .
and so for all these reasons we are officially broken up . thank you and good night .
but i proved it .
well then i am going to have to ask you to turn your key .
turn your key maura . turn your key .
jerry .
i bought it .
sounds like a scam .
so i broke up with maura . it 's done . i 'm out .
feels right .
he 's staring at us .
want a bite ?
i think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just coke and sprite mixed together . how can i prove it ? ah . ca n't dammit .
what ? m maura what are you doing here ? i ended this relationship twice .
why does it always seem like i 'm the only one working at this break up ?
all right .
hey .
seeing maura . apparently i was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt .
who 's this blue arrow ?
hey elaine . maybe his girlfriend is lois loan .
hey maybe this cheating thing is what i could use to ditch maura .
she 's like a district attorney . if it 's not the truth i 'll break under the cross . i actually have to do it .
hey you know there 's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me .
she 's too tanned . it 's the middle of the winter she 's like a carrot .
so you you say you 've been in the city all winter ?
well heeere we are
ho ho .
are you sure ? cause it could really help me out of a jam .
oh not more building .
no ?
all right .
this is n't going well .
you do n't need the cufflinks . you have the same name . jerry' .
it 's a big night . i 'm uh ice skating with one and going to a staged reading of godspell with the other .
it does n't matter .
the uh actor that played jesus made some odd choices .
i mean uh i had fun ice skating .
maura . oh my god . what are you doing here ? .
uhh . i 'm caught in my own web of lies .
this is all blowing up in my face . my serious girlfriend and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths . i have ruined three lives well i understand if you never want to see me again so
what ? so this is still not over ?
you ?
all right .
all right . i 'm going to try giving them fifty five dollars each what do you think ?
so what 's in the cooler ?
when are they going to learn that any news about china is an instant page turner ? what 's that ?
how much was it ?
where are you getting a wizard for fifty dollars ?
i got a message from the rosses at work today .
at the funeral give or take . you know deep down i always kinda felt that they blamed me for susan 's death .
no he is n't .
i thought he looked irish .
that 's not irish .
should we be talking about this ?
no it is n't .
well it would be ok if darryl was here .
uh yeah . hang on . just yeah .
uh mrs . ross ? it 's it 's george .

well you know i 've been lying about my income for a few years . i figured i could afford a fake house in the hamptons .
how are they going to make that book into a movie ?
yeah ?
oh .
ooh .
aww .
you must hate hot dogs huh ? or else you uh you really like em and that 's why you you do this .
i 'll tell ya if i had one of these things i 'd be eating hot dogs all the time .
mmm no .
actually i did have a thought .
why do n't you just ask him ?
maybe he 's um mixed .
i really do n't think we 're supposed to be talking about this .
i 'm just going to go to the bathroom .
yeah .
rosses .
well sorry i missed that uh charity thing . but this was one of those truly glorious hampton weekends that you always hear about .
yeah i may move out there . i mean it i 'll do it . ok i 'll see ya later . keep it real .
jerry ?
what are you doing here ?
he asked you to get the mail ?
jerry why is elaine getting your mail ?
what about the mail ?
all right jerry . i 'll do it . see ya .
so i ran into the rosses again .
from me .
i told them i have a place in the hamptons . what did you say ?
so they knew ? those liars .
yeah but they let me go on and on all about the hamptons they never said a thing . you do n't let somebody lie when they know you 're lying . you call them a liar .
yes . thank you . is that so hard ?
hmm hmm not by a long shot . i 'm calling up the rosses and inviting them up to my non existent place in the hamptons . then we 'll see who blinks first .
this is not about them . now if you 'll excuse me i have to exercise jerry 's gaskets .
so here i am . ready to take you to the hamptons .
do you have your bathing suits ?
speak now or we are headed to the hamptons . it 's a two hour drive . once you get in that car we are going all the way to the hamptons . all right you want to get nuts ? come on . let 's get nuts .
you want to hear more ? the master bedroom opens into the solarium .
yes two solariums . quite a find . and i have horses too ?
snoopy and prickly pete . should i keep driving ?
housewarming gift . all right we 're taking it up a notch .
almost there .
we uh we go on foot from here .
there 's no house . it 's a lie . there 's no solarium . there 's no prickly pete . there 's no other solarium .
then why ? why did you make me drive all the way out here ? why did n't you say something ? why ? why ? why ?
oh .
well i know when i 'm a little strapped i sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it . that could buy us some time .
or we do n't even send the check and then when they call we pretend we 're the cleaning service . heh heh . hello ? i sorry no here kruger . '
i had em jerry . they loved me .
i lost them . i can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it 's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns .
i ca n't just leave .
you never played vegas .
i like christian rock . it 's very positive . it 's not like those real musicians who think they 're so cool and hip .
tell you how you could check .
reprogram all the buttons see if he changes them back . you know ? the old switcheroo .
no it 's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you .
well that 's the gist of it .
nah .
by the way how did puddy get back in the picture ?
alright well why do n't we smooth the head down to nothing stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to ichabod crane ?
alright . that 's it for me . goodnight everybody .
i knew i had hit my high note so i thanked the crowd and i was gone .
i saw titanic . so that old woman she 's just a liar right ?
hey so did you give that radio the old switcheroo ?
and the christian rock ?
jerry do you have any fishsticks ?
i think it 's neat . you do n't hear that much about god anymore .
i 'm against all it 's me 's . so self absorbed and egotistical it 's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes .
they ? the government ?
i guess there are no small diseases only small actors .
alright that 's it for me . good night everybody .
she 's still doing that ?
alright i 'll tell you what you do . you call her back and give her the it 's me' heh ? pull the old switcheroo .

oh . okay here it is i got it . she lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on . they do it every day .
how 's her handshake ? a little firm is n't it ? maybe a little too firm ?
hands a little smelly ?

and a slice of devil 's food cake .
hey . where is everyone ?
i am ?
this is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders .
okay .

well if she keeps horsing around with that tractor
two man ? it 's all me . kruger does n't do anything disappears for hours at a time gives me fake excuses . this afternoon i found him with sleep creases on his face . the only reason i got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work . oh i do n't believe this . this is what i have to put up with jerry . mr . kruger ? who said he was going to do some actual work today ? who ?
well i am . could n't you try to go through some of that stuff i put in your shoebox ?

i think that 's mr . hayman . the gym teacher from our high school .
he 's older completely covered in filth no whistle but i think it 's him .
i did n't tattle
there was an incident . i 'd rather not discuss it .
some other time .
let 's see if it 's hayman ?
i do n't understand lunch i do n't know anything about lunch . listen . just because i got the guy fired does n't mean i turned him into a bum does it ?
he purposely mispronounced my name . instead of saying costanza he 'd say ca n't stand ja . ca n't stand ja he made me smell my own gym socks once .
ok ok i never even had him for gym .
little baked beans
well ok . as i said the guy had it in for me . he actually failed me in gym . me .
those spastic shnitzer twins
yes mr . hayman
well i guess that 's because i wear boxer shorts .
i 'm not really sure i
he gave me a wedgie .
because the underwear is pulled up from the back and it wedges in
i got to go back to the library and talk to him . i got to find out if i&macNUM m the guy who ruined his life .
jerry it 's me george do n't worry i 'll return it
it 's george
well it 's definetly him .
him who ? hayman him .
oh i found him . he was sitting on the steps of the library . i sat down next to him . he smelled like the locker room after that game against erasmus
so i said mr . hayman it 's me george costanza jfk he does n't move . so i said uh ca n't stand ya'' ca n't stand ya' he turns and smiles the little baked bean teeth . i get up to run away but something was holding me back . it was heyman . he had my underwear . there i was on the steps of the NUMnd st . library a grown man getting a wedgie .
it was .
how should i know ?
me ?
the locker room .
jerry it 's me george do n't worry i 'll return it tomorrow no problem .

no that 's not enough btus for my living room that was a complete waste of time .
you should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car . he 'd go from state to state . he was away for weeks at a time . it was like he was running for president and he was going through the primaries . we 'd get phone calls from motels in new hampshire .
well at least you accomplished something . you got fish .

this is just what i need .
there 's elevators all over . it all looks the same .
you come to a parking lot you write it down . how hard is that ?
it 's this way and they take off again pairing off
six wrong ?
oh i got it . that i 'm supposed to remember . where the car is that 's insignificant .

it 's george .
i have to talk to you about something .

all right i 've become attracted to elaine
kramer can we do this later
really ? you think .
so now you 're doing my bits ?
no .
i ca n't say .
because i promised her .
she does n't .
because she asked me to .
all right you really want to know ? it all started when she told met hat she was the voice on your tape recorder .
yeah . she made me promise not to tell you . it 's supposed to be a joke .
well let me hear
you heard it fifty times already .
do n't tell her anything she 'll kill me .
he he threatened me .
elaine i have to tell you something
no no no no no no no
i 'm very attracted to you
ever since i found out that you let that message on jerry 's tape recorder i
heuh . huh . stick around a while .
where 'd you meet her ?
on an elevator ? you met a woman on an elevator ?
you got less than sixty seconds . that 's like dismantling a time bomb . what got into you ?
wow . what 'd you say ?
wow .
what did she say ?
not everybody knows what the crop circles are . do you know what the crop circles are ?
what ?
oh man it 's spinach . i 've been walking around like this all afternoon .
i had a job interview .
take a guess .
ok thanks .
yeah right .
oh nothing .
you wo n't think i 'm a bad person ?
cause believe me i would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist maybe . well her nose is a little big .
i mean big would even be ok a little beyond big .
now i 'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection .
so who am i to be thinking about someone 's nose ? i mean i should be grateful someone like her even looks at me . i have no job nothing . but i have to say i think about the nose . i do n't want to think about the nose . i do n't ask to think about the nose but i think about it . i go to bed at night i tell myself do n't think about the nose forget the nose but i think about it . i look at her i see nose .
i could never do that . you know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose i never could have gone out with her in the first place . she 'd be out of my league with a smaller nose . and i really like her i know that . and i know one other thing . i 'm not getting past that nose .
how can i not think about it ? look at the size of this thing .
why do n't you just commit yourself already ?
what you did n't wash all day ?
thinking ? nothing . what could i possibly be thinking ?
oh yeah right . i wish i had something on my mind . so how about that kramer huh ?
they way he just says stuff .
yeah . yeah he 's quite a character .
about the pizza ?
oh the nose job . i do n't know what did you think ?
yeah . not that i care one way or the other but these doctors today really do amazing things you know if you were so inclined . and again i 'm not suggesting .
peter jennings had one .
probably . they all do . in my high school half my graduating class had them . of course i 'm from long island so
it 's really nothing it 's like going to the dentist .
it 's a cleaning .
if it makes you happy i do n't focus on these things . i will tell you this unfortunately we live in a very superficial society . i do n't condone it but it 's a fact of life .
what the hell .
me ? i did n't say anything .
i did n't encourage . no encourage .
it 's possible .
me too really . unless you 'd really like to get one .
i 'm going straight to hell no two ways about it .
hey let 's get the check she 's taking the bandages off at four o'clock .
it 's exciting is n't it ? she 's going to have a whole new face .
of course not as exciting as miss crop circles but
you 're not letting him win . he wins till you 're forty .
he still wins but it 's not a blowout .
good for you .
it 's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring .
okay look audrey before you take the bandage off just remember that i was the one that encouraged you to do this you know ? now that you 're going to be a great beauty let 's not forget how this all began . you know like if you 'd listened to your friend elaine
yeah ?
very exciting very exciting it 's like watching a birth .
too much salt in my diet .
nah i 'm good .
mmm no . boy it really did n't come out too well did it ?
it 's like all dented .
well i 'm sure they 'll be able to fix it . you ca n't stop modern science . ca n't stop it you ca n't stop it . ca n't stop science . ca n't be stopped no way no how science just marches
shut up ?
interesting .
yeah .
oh i got it .
yeah phew .

hawaii ?
you know hawaii could be a little tricky right now there 's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year there 's a lot of debris constantly flying around . wood and uh lava pretty dangerous .
oh yeah . my friend lived there .
you know i have to tell you something . you could n't get me on a plane right now . i get those faa reports directly . my uncle sends them to me he used to be a pilot so . big investigation in the uh what 's the word there uh offing . it 's in the offing . but you know you should n't let that stop you from going . you could go . i do n't mind .
audrey ? my god you look incredible . i ca n't believe it .
elaine . shut up .
because my cousin 's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet .
that 's not funny . so are you coming to the party ?

jersey .
i gave her a twenty she only gave me change for a ten .
excuse me i gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten .
i 'm positive i gave you a twenty .
you owe me ten dollars .
alright let 's just examine the situation for a second . who in this situation would be more likely to make a mistake ? me who had access to my wallet knew exactly what was in there ? or you
no no no see you 're not really listening .
no problem . there 's no problem . she just owes me ten dollars that 's all .
oh so you do n't believe me either ?

(waving eva .
oh no you did n't . get out when ?
i do n't believe it .
mark is this true ?
how 's it going ?
i ca n't believe what 's happening here . she has n't taken her hands off me all night . she was always friendly around the office but that was it .
i do n't know maybe a safe fell on her head .
no i would have picked up on it . i can always tell when a woman likes me they always somehow let you know . with me they could torture me i would n't tell them . if anything i 'd try to make them think i do n't like them then they think oh look at this guy he 's not even looking at me he must have something going for him . '
now ?
gimme a half hour .
listen i have a tremendous favor to ask .
i think something 's happening here .
i think she wants me to take her home .

she told me she wants she told me she wants me to make love to her .
yeah .
i swear .
i i i ca n't .
please it 's
i i i long for you .
i was so shocked i was lucky i said anything .
i do n't like when a woman says make love to me' it 's intimidating . the last time a woman said that to me i wound up apologizing to her .
that 's a lot of pressure . make love to me . what am i in the circus ? what if i ca n't deliver ?
i ca n't perform under pressure . that 's why i never play anything for money i choke . i could choke tonight . and she works in my office can you imagine ? she goes around telling everyone what happened ? maybe i should cancel i have a very bad feeling about this .
i know i know i ca n't stop it .
yeah good night .
could we talk about this some other time ?
hey i 've eaten frogs so nobody 's perfect . anyway
goldfish .
that 's why we 're here in america .
yeah me either .
what come on ? have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office ?
you know the anxiety you feel on a date ? that 's what i have every day now . my worst nightmare 's come true every day is a date .
ava was one of the reasons i used to like going to work she was a friend . now we sleep together and suddenly i do n't know how to talk to her . every time i go to the bathroom i pass her desk . i have to plan little patter . i spend half my day writing . then afterwards i sit in my office and analyze how it went . if it was a good conversation i do n't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day . i see her laughing and talking with other people they 're all so loose and relaxed i think that used to be me . i want to go back there again . '
i have no choice i 'm quitting .
how much is that ?
nine sixty ? give it to me .

maybe she just wants to talk to me ?
oh my god an affair . that 's so adult . it 's like with stockings and martinis and william holden . on the other hand it probably would n't cost me any money .
i ca n't have an affair with a married woman that 's despicable .
well who is she ?
oh right right . the blue sweatpants . gees it 's too bad you ca n't say anything because of angela .

she said first row . right behind the dugout .
i was all primed for the first row i was going to put my feet up on the dugout .

i 'd rather go to a hanging .
yeah ?

i 'm not paying $NUM for this . it 's a piece of junk .
why did you even take it ? you broke up with her .
you were n't thinking .
well i 'm not buying it . no way . forget it . no way i 'm buying this . i mean look at it . what is it ? it 's a bunch of squiggly lines . are you telling me you could n't paint this ?
i 'm not paying for this . if you were going out with her it 'd be a different story .
hey kramer .
what ?
what 's it say ?
wow .
it 's george .
hey nina . i owe you some money do n't i ?
oh yeah me too me too . boy oh boy oh boy . you know in fact i 've been thinking about it and i feel like i 'm stealing from you . five hundred dollars . it 's going to be worth thousands soon . you know what ? on second thought i ca n't even accept it .
this could be in a museum some day . it 's not safe with me . it should really be in a doormanned building .
who said anything about money ?
i just popped in now . i 'm a big pop in guy .
how bout kramer .
give it . give it . pinheads .
this is incredible .
maybe i wo n't send her that check .
five thousand ? why would anybody buy kramer for $NUM ?
so is it all over between you and marsha mason ?
tell you what i 'll make a deal with you . i 'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks .
behind the dugout that 's where we were sitting the other day .
i really think it looks good .
all bald people look good in hats .
what a bald paradise that must have been . nobody knew .
no i ca n't . what if i meet a woman ? i 'd always be worried about that first moment where i 'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face .
do you hear that ?
you had to move the mirror ?
i went to look in the mirror it was n't there . you threw off my equilibrium .
i ca n't drive ?
nobody drives like me . nobody . i 'm doing things in this car you have no idea they 're going on . want to see me make a right turn from the left lane ? watch this .
and i can make a left turn from the right lane too .
what are we going to tell jerry about the car ?
alright start looking for spaces .
look i have my system . first i look for the dream spot right in front of the door then i slowly expand out in concentric circles .
i ca n't park in a garage .
i do n't know i just ca n't . nobody in my family can pay for parking it 's a sickness . my father never paid for parking my mother my brother nobody . we ca n't do it .
you do n't understand . a garage . i ca n't even pull in there . it 's like going to a prostitute . why should i pay when if i apply myself maybe i could get it for free ? what ? what do you want ? go around me i 'm looking for spaces .
oh beautiful . look at that the dream space right in front of jerry 's building . huh ? dreams can come true what did i tell you ?
alright now you 're going to see some parallel parking . how i wish you could make a living parallel parking . it 's all geometry knowing all the angles when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in that 's the key .
there 's nothing i can even impart to you that 's the sad thing . it 's so inborn i ca n't pass it on . look at this guy . are you crazy what are you doing ? . hey . hey you 're stealing my space .
no no no he 's not getting away with this .
hey what are you doing ?
you ca n't do that you ca n't just sneak in from the back like that .
well if you did n't think i was parking why did you put it in head first ?
i was in the middle of a conversation .
the point is i was here first .
but i 'm backing in . you ca n't put it in head first .
are you going to move the car ?
jerk .
do you believe this guy ?
i am not putting it in a garage it 's my space .
are you coming back down ?
alright just make sure he reserves the good chair for me . wait what are you going to tell him about the clanking noise in the car ?
oh come on you 're good at this .
i do n't know i do n't know you 'll think of something .
hey .
yeah i 'm fine .
what ?
what you know jerry ?
how do you know him ?
because i know him too and probably a lot better than you .
what you know kramer ? .
and you 're watching the fight at jerry 's ?
oh great .
it 's my space .
i 'll die out here .
oh come on .
me ? you see what he did here you see how he tried to sneak into my space ?
you only went in front first cause you saw me backing up and you did n't have room to parallel park .
you 've got a prayer .
did you talk to him ?
you told him ? what did you tell him ?
i do n't believe it what did you say ?
a pack of teenagers ?
you are a genius it 's as simple as that .
oh great .
well i did n't know you wanted to go to the flea market .
hey who 's talking to you ?
what ? every time i leave my house now i have to call everybody i know and ask them if they want to do what i 'm doing ?
great move telling him by the way real smart move .
judgement jerry judgement . you exercised no judgement .
yeah i 'm sorry .
what was wrong with that sorry ? it was a good sorry . jerry was that a good sorry ?
you heard the man . i guess you got to be moving your car .
yeah .
uh huh .
well you know it 's interesting you know under that pressure what you 're capable of .
i learned a lot about myself .
i could n't help it . elaine moved the mirror i got discombobulated .
no no i never said i was a good driver i said i was a good parker .
parker i never said driver i said parker a great parker .
no no no that 's in the right position .
no you were n't . stop there that 's fine .
do you ?
sid it 's completely his fault .
do n't do it .
yes . i 'm not giving him the satisfaction it 's my space .
no no this is a matter of principle . that would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want . well i 'm making a stand here . i 'm saying no to head first parking . i 'm not putting up with that . we put up with too much crap in this city we 're not putting up with head first parking .
so you 're against me now ?
he 's right . never .

exactly you know what i 'm talking about right ?
uh jerry you want your blankets tucked in ?
you want your blankets tucked in ?
when lupe makes up the beds in the morning .

yeah yeah yeah yeah go . go about your business i 'll just wander around .
go go go do n't worry about it .
hey . corbin bernsen .
big fan . big fan .
hey you grew a beard huh ?
hey . you know do i have a case for you guys to do on l . a . law .
so mind you at this point i 'm only going out with her two or three weeks . so she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat . so at this time there 's a lot of stuff going on in my life and uh it slips my mind for a few days . maybe a week . not a week five six days .
well it 's the damnedest thing . the cat dies . so she comes back into town she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board .
that 's what she says . i say listen . it was an old cat . it died of natural causes . so get this now she tells me that i got to buy her a brand new cat . i say listen honey . first of all it was a pretty old cat . i 'm not going to buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat . and second of all i go out to the garbage i find you a new cat in fifteen seconds . i say you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation i spring for a new cat . so she says something to me like uh i dunno get the hell out of here and she breaks up with me . now do n't you think that would be a great case on l . a . law ?
i do n't want to tell you how to run your show .
but really it 's enough with the bar already .
seriously have they though about changing the setting ?
really ? because people do meet in places besides a bar huh ?
what about a rec room ? huh ? or a community center .
yeah ?
fabulous i 'll think about that george thank you .
great . great . i actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with corbin bernsen and george wendt .
yeah yeah not fan talk not gushing you know ? actual conversation i was incredibly articulate .
what are you crazy ? you were fine .
conveyor belt .
i ca n't believe you 're blaming lupe ?
he 's on the lamb he 's on the loose .
what are we supposed to do ? what do you do on a situation like this ? should we call a lawyer should we call the police ?
hope he 's not the guy .
god i 'm starved i 'm weak from hunger .
time like what ? i 'm hungry . my stomach does n't know that kramer 's wanted .
i could n't have breakfast it was lunchtime . the three hour time difference threw me . i wanted a tuna fish sandwich they would n't serve me tuna fish sandwich because they were only serving breakfast .
for lunch ? who eats eggs for lunch ?
why did n't you say something then ?
i need food jerry . i feel faint i 'm getting light headed .
pay phone in l . a . look it 's a miracle .
no i do n't have any change . i never carry change .
i have a ten .
i hate asking for change . they always make a face . like i 'm asking them to donate a kidney .
what ?
breath problem ?
tell me .
you know i have n't eaten anything .
why do n't you just call NUM ?
of course it is .
your friend is been accused of being a serial killer . i think that qualifies .
what 's the matter with you ? are you crazy ? why are you using my name ? .
what am i scared of ? i 'm scared of the same thing that you are everything . why do n't you just use your own name ?
really ?
you think so ?
i do n't know .
excuse me where are we ?
excuse me ms . which street are we on ?
you do n't know ?
how come you do n't know what street are you on ?

tarragon ? oh you 're crazy .
yeah take care . stay in touch .
no you 're crushing my sandwich .
mint ?
i 've got to tell you i 'm really disappointed in lupe .
do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home ?
you would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks throw in a few soaps .
i 'll tell you something if i 'd own a company my employees would love me . they 'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home like lenin .
oh my god i forgot .
kramer what are you doing here ?
what did they do for toilet paper in the civil war ?
i wonder what toilet paper was loike in the NUM 's . did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags ?
what ?
all right so what did they do ?
well i think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it .
uh c r e s p i ?
i 'm unbelievable at spelling last names . give me a last name .
huh ? all right fine .
what was that all about ?
for what ?
your own show ?
they want you to do a tv show ?
come on how hard is that ? look at all the junk that 's on tv . you want an idea ? here 's an idea . you coach gymnastics team in high school . and you 're married . and your son 's not interested in gymnastics and you 're pushing him into gymnastics .
because you 're a gymnastics teacher . it 's only natural .
i know but he 's your son .
all right forget that idea it 's not for you okay okay i got it . you run an antique store .
and people come in the store and you get involved in their lives .
why not ?
i know but antiques are very popular right now .
oh yeah like you know .
really ?
i ca n't believe she got involved with a shrink .
so what 's happening with the tv show ? you come up with anything ?
why do n't they have salsa on the table ?
salsa is now the number one condiment in america .
you know it must be impossible for a spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa . i wanted seltzer not salsa . '
see this should be a show . this is the show .
this . just talking .
i 'm really serious . i think that 's a good idea .
it 's about nothing .
no forget the story .
who says you got to have a story ? remember when we were waiting for for that table in that chinese restaurant that time ? that could be a tv show .
i could be a character .
yeah . you could base a character on me .
yeah . there 's something wrong with that ? i 'm a character . people are always saying to me you know you 're a quite a character . '
elaine could be a character . kramer
right .
absolutely nothing .
we go into nbc .
writer . we 're talking about a sit com .
yeah . i think we really go something here .
an idea .
an idea for the show .
it 's about nothing .
everybody 's doing something we 'll do nothing .
exactly .
there you go .
nothing .
no i 'm fine . i 'm good . i 'm very good .
no not nervous . i 'm good very good . i ca n't do this . ca n't do this .
i ca n't do this . i ca n't do it . i have tried . i 'm here . it 's impossible .
what idea ? i just said something . i did n't know you were going to listen to me .
they 're men with jobs jerry . they wear suits and ties . they 're married they have secretaries .
i need some water . i got to get some water .
really ? that 's pretty good .
who ?
what was that ?
okay okay . look you do all the talking okay ?
yeah they 're not better than me .
who are they ?
what about me ?
why them ? why not me ?
i 'm as good as them .
you really think so ?
the parakeet in the mirror . that 's a good one stu .
well possibly . i wrote an off broadway show la cocina . actually it was off off broadway . it was a comedy about a mexican chef .
pepe .
no no he mimed it . that 's what was so funny about it .
may i ?
i think i can sum up the show for you with one word nothing .
nothing .
the show is about nothing .
no it 's about nothing .
is it with a y ?
yeah but nothing happens on the show . you see it 's just like life . you know you eat you go shopping you read you eat you read you go shopping .
oh no . no stories .
what 'd you do today ?
there 's a show . that 's a show .
no no no . nothing happens .
because it 's on tv .
okay uh look if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you . i for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity . and i 'll tell you something else this is the show and we 're not going to change it . right ?
. . . i thought the woman was kind of cute .
yeah i thought i might give her a call . i i do n't meet that many women . i meet like three women a year . i mean we 've been introduced . she knows my name .
why ? maybe she liked me . i i mean she was looking right at me . you know i think she was impressed . you know we had good eye contact the whole meeting .
wait a minute let me call susan .
she might be leaving to work any minute .
no .
it 's george .
hello oh hello . you remember susan from n b c .
and this is kramer .
all right go ahead susan tell him .
well go ahead tell him .
and susan the third ?
i never should have brought her up there . should have known better . should have seen it coming . i did n't see it coming .
you know she was behind the idea . she was going to champion the show . that 's what i was bring her up there to tell you . and she liked me .
what are you crazy ? it 's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on .
chamberlind you could hold his head in nthe toilet he 'd still give you half of europe .
holly .
wait a second . . all right .
it 's george .
ah . you 're just the man i 'm looking for .
yeah here you go .
a dry cleaning bill ?

well i should n't have to pay for it .
yeah your milk .
eighteen dollars .
i do n't know .
what 's yo yo ma ?
all right come on come on let 's go . six dollars .
i know .
the show . forget about the show . we should take the idea to a different network
it was a good idea . susan liked it . now if he had n't vomitted all over her we 'd be writing it right now .
anyway .
what ?
they want to have another meeting ? they want to buy it ? . they want to but it ? . oh . i tell you . we 're going to be rich . what are we going to get for this ? fifty sixty thousand ?
oh it 's got to be fifty . hee hee . you know how much ted danson makes huh ?

the story is the foundation of all entertainment . you must have a good story otherwise it 's just masturbation .
care ? forget about care . love . they have to love the characters . otherwise why would they keep tuning in ?
would they tune in ?
the show will be like a heart attack .

i think we got a bite on it .
ohh i have tremendous respect for people who work with feet . i mean to dedicate yourself to the foot you 're toiling in virtual anonymity . i mean
oh uh the cigars i 'm uh sucking em down . i 'm puffing my brains out yeah .

yeah burned . whoo
eh but you know mr . ross if if you look at the whole situating what with it being your cigars and everything it 's really rather ironic one might even say in a sense comical really . think about it .

i was trying to loosen em up a little bit .
alright still her father did n't have to throw me out like that he could have just asked me to leave . the guy had me in a headlock . susan 's not going tonight you know .
i do n't know she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport . it cost me a hundred dollars this ticket .
that 's a very good question . you know she and i go out for dinner she does n't even reach for the check . that ? s all i ? m asking for is a reach . is that so much to ask for ?
wait a minute wait a minute do you think i ? m comfortable here . i ca n't change i ? ve got no clothes here . you 've got to go like that i can ? t go like this alone .
that ? s not the issue we 're friends if i ? ve got to be uncomfortable you 've got to be uncomfortable too .
what ? really ?
people are looking for tickets here ?
oh man . i knew i was going to love the opera .
all right all right .
oh wait is n't scalping illegal ?
ok it 's a deal .
no ? are you crazy ?
five hundred dollars that ? s a great deal .
did you see that ? the guy 's walking away . what is wrong with you ? that was a three hundred dollar profit .
this is not a metallica concert it ? s an opera alright a little dignity a little class just give me my ticket i will stand over here and sell it .
thank you very much . you just stand over there i ? ll stand over here .

we 're not dead .
come on . we got all day tomorrow to come up with a story .
so we 'll do it tomorrow .
about six years ago .
women like skiers .
yeah . right .
the closet business ? what 's the closet business ?
i 'm interested .
so you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her .
yeah . so what happened ?
marla .
stacey .
jerry . marla . stacey .
anyway we met with nbc about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot . in fact we got a big meeting with them tomorrow . they got to approve of the story before we can write .
not a bad way to make a buck .
well i 'll tell you stacey . it 's a lot of hard work . but it comes fairly easy to me . some people write symphonies . this is my gift .
i might .
what ? i 'm not married . i 'm not allowed to go out with somebody else ?
depends on what ?
like what ?
no . semi daily . four or five times a week .
implied .
there might be some moisturizer .
yeah .
what ?
ah no no . are you sure ? a girlfriend ?
would you believe my luck ? the first time in my life i have a good answer to the question what do you do ? and i have a girlfriend . i mean you do n't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question . that 's what you say in order to get girlfriends . once you can get a girlfriend you do n't want a girlfriend you just want more girlfriends .
well it 's not fair jerry . it 's just not fair . all right all right . that 's it . i 'm getting out of this thing .
no what ?
why ? what do you mean ?
oh right . oh no man .
yeah yeah . i see the irony . all right . what about this ? what if i can find some way to break up with her so that she 'll still like me and it does n't affect the deal .
wait wait . here me out . do n't dismiss this . you 're very quick to dismiss . do n't dismiss . she 's got a big crush on david letterman i mean a big crush . she talks about him all the time . suppose i go up to david letterman . he works at nbc i work at nbc . i explain my situation . he agrees to meet her . they go out they fall madly in love . and she dumps me for david letterman .
no no . i 'm just thinking .
it 's george .
she 's a virgin ?
wow . so what 're you going to do ?
i do n't think i could do it . you know they always remember the first time . i do n't want to be remembered . i want to be forgotten .
you know sometimes those guys do n't make it back . i 'm really hungry .
we got to get something . i do n't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach . let 's get some chinese . you want to order it ?
what do you want ?
i 'll tell you what . why do n't we just get a couple of dishes and we 'll just share em .
i 'm going to get a chow fung .
it 's a broad noodle .
it 's a big flat noodle .
what kind of noodle do you want ?
all right look . i 'm getting the chow fung . you do n't have to have any .
fine .
where 's the food ? what happened to ping ?
hey what about this ? i 'm in a car accident . the motorist is uninsured you with me ?
my car 's totaled . it 's all his fault and now he has absolutely no money . there is no way that he can pay me . so the judge decrees that he becomes my butler .
right . he cooks my food he cleans my house he does all my shopping for me . and there you go that 's your program .
do n't worry we 'll find something for you .
something happened to the food ?
the pea pods ? all you saved was the pea pods ?
he dropped it .
we got work to do . what about the meeting ?
all right let 's postpone it . let 's get out of here .
i 'll fake an illness . my back . my back . i ca n't believe my back .
i can do this jerry .
all right i 'll tell them my sister died . my poor sister died . she was standing and then she was laughing and then they shot her . that 's the kind of sick city that we 're living in . they shoot you for laughing . i must go and comfort my poor family . jerry take me home so i can comfort my my poor family .
that 's david letterman . i just saw david letterman walk by . i 'll be right back .
you telling em about the butler story ? is that beautiful or what ? hey sorry i 'm late . russell ?
oh rita . hey mr . shermack how 're you doing good to see you . jay always a pleasure . sweetie . yeah yeah that butler idea that 's beautiful . is n't that killer ? i thought i was getting the butler .
no he said there was nothing he could do and next time i should probably break the prozacs in half .
i bet they 're probably doing summersaults about us over there . you think they get butler stories like that everyday ?
hi it 's me . it 's georgie boy . what 's going on ?
fired ? why ?
but i had no i did n't realize .
i just feel terrible this is just terrible .
this is great . he fired her . this is incredible he fired her . i 'm out baby . i 'm out .
because i kissed her in the meeting . russell found out he fired her over the phone . finally my stupidity pays off .
what ?
another job ?
oh this is unbelievable . i 'm stuck . every time i think i 'm out they pull me back in .
what do i do ? well actually i 'm a writer . in fact i 'm writing a comedy pilot for nbc right now .
my mother caught me .
you know . i was alone
uh huh .
i stopped by the house to drop the car off and i went inside for a few minutes nobody was there they 're supposed to be working . my mother had a glamour magazine i started leafing through it
so one thing lead to another
first she screams george what are you doing ? . my god . and it looked like she was going to faint she started clutching the wall trying to hang onto it .
i did n't know whether to try and keep her from falling or zip up .
i zipped up .
yeah . well i could n't run over there the way i was .
so she fell and then she started screaming my back . my back . so i picked her up and took her to the hospital .
she 's in traction .
it 's not funny elaine .
her back went out . she 's got to be there for a couple of days . all she said on the way over in the car was why george why ? . i said because it 's there .
well i 'll tell you this though i am never doing that again .
all together .
you do n't think i can ?
you think you could ?
care to make it interesting ?
a hundred dollars .
alright look you want to be in ?
you got to give us odds . at least two to one you got to put up two hundred dollars .
alright you 're in for one fifty .
alright now how are we going to monitor this thing ?
no ma i 'm not going to see a psychiatrist . n i do n't care if you do pay for it . no . discussion over . yeah alright i 'll see you later . yes of course i 'm going to come by . alright . my mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now . why ? . because she caught me ? you know if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist
whatever .
she 'll be fine . i got to go to the hospital to see her tonight .
hey what are you doing tonight ?

i figured you 'd cruise . at least through the spring .
ohhhhh john john .
and then there were two .
hey what happened ?
i thought you were meeting kennedy .
yeah he did .
no no no . he just left .
yeah he was talking to marla .
yeah i think you know she was like crying and he was consoling her and then she uh just got into his car and they just drove away .
yeah .
yeah drove away you know i said hello to him . you know he 's he 's
kramer ? .
hey thanks for coming with me .
i confused it with another awning .
we 're perfect . i timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal exactly NUM minutes after their flight is supposed to land . that gives them just enough time to get off the plane pick up their bags and be walking out of the terminal as we roll up . i tell you it 's a thing of beauty . i can not express to you the feeling i get from a perfect airport pickup . what 's going on ? what are you doing ? the long island expressway ? what are you getting on the long island expressway for ? do you know what the traffic will be like ? this is a suicide mission .
oh i had it perfectly timed out the grand central the van wyck . you destroyed my whole timing .
do you know what happens if i miss him ? i do n't get credit for the pickup and i lose my NUM bucks
really ?
the duty free shop ? duty free is the biggest sucker deal in retail . do you know how much duty is ?
yeah duty . do you know how much duty is ?
duty is nothing . it 's like sales tax
i like to stop at the duty free shop .
they 're not here . you cost me fifty bucks .
look we 're wasting our time here . we 're a half hour late they 've probably took it off the board already .
canceled ? do i still get credit for the pick up ? i was here .
no what guy ?
listen you go over to the ticket counter i 'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of time magazine . there 's supposed to ba blurb about jerry in it and i think he mentioned my name .
gee i 'm sorry i got here first .
you do n't understand there 's a blurb about me in this magazine .
umm no .
but you are blanche you are in the shackles . oh i ca n't wait to read my time magazine . laaaast copy too . maybe i 'll read it tomorrow in the park . it 's supposed to be a beeyootiful day . have a nice life sentence that is .
laguardia ? all right let 's go . c 'mon
my name is not mentioned in this blurb
who 's grossbard ?
hey kramer c 'mon it was NUM bucks twenty years ago
no no no kramer . kramer . kramer . you cannot abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup . it 's a binding social contract . we we must go forward not back .
well you 're not going to believe it
the plane 's been re routed back to kennedy . we 've got NUM minutes .
there it is . gate NUM we got plenty of time .
how you going to catch him ? he 's probably boarded the plane already .
my credit card ?
i 'm not going to give you my card unless you tell me what it 's for .
what are you nuts ? you 're going to spend more on the ticket than you 're going to get back from grossbard .
this is a great idea . here use this one . i get frequent flyer miles with every purchase wait . get two tickets . as long as your turning it in for a refund what 's the difference ? i 'll get double the bonus miles .
super savers ? are they refundable . ?
you bought non refundable tickets you idiot .
do you know how much this is going to cost me ?
look i 'm going to go to the bathroom
kramer .
i loved her jerry i loved her .
and she loved me . hoo ho she really did .
what am i going to do now ? i ca n't live without susan . i got to get her back . how ? how am i going to get her back ?
who says ?
ah a beautiful successful intelligent woman 's in love with me and i throw it all away . uh oh boy . now i 'll spend the rest of my life living alone . i 'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games eating chinese take out . walking around with no underwear . because i 'm too lazy to do a laundry .
yeah what do you do when you run out of laundry ?
who am i going to meet who is better than her ? no one jerry . no one 's better than her .
i loved her .
i would give anything to be going up those stairs again .
i got to call her . should i call her ?
whyie ?
i 'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to europe with .
she any good ?
wa uh
my darling susan . my darling .
my little man does n't know .
my little man 's an idiot .
she kept such a nice clean apartment . she was so sanitary .
she made a big breakfast every sunday . i do n't know what she put in those eggs .
oh hey if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me . tell her i 'm sorry . tell her i need my baby oh wo n't you tell her i love her . oh hey
well hello . um ah specifically the reason that i 'm here uh i do n't know uh what elaine told you but uh i broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago . actually she broke up with me and uh well i was the cause of it and uh i just wanted to find out from you what 's with this thing ?
yeah and why wo n't this go down ?
what is with this damn zipper ?
it 's stuck on a piece of cloth here . i ca n't get the cloth out .
this is a brand new jacket . boy this really burns me up
susan .
uh ha ha it 's just so frustrating . it 's a brand new jacket .
pull it up a little bit .
yeah okey wait wait . that will separate .
take it right off the chest
you 're going to rip it . you 're going to rip it .
okay . uh my mother is is going to pay for the sessions . oh elaine ?

was it a scratch or a pick ?
hey . it 's me .
was there any nostril penetration ?
so let 's say in her mind she witnessed a pick . okay so then what ?
i guarantee you that moses was a picker . you wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air . you telling me you 're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit .
no . that 's disgusting .
hey . how come i did n't get a christmas card ? everybody else got one . jerry got one kramer got one . i thought we were good friends . i do n't get a christmas card . i do n't get it .
why do n't you call her agency . maybe she 's been out of town and she did n't get the calls .
it 'll be different this time .
i 'm not stable ? i 'm like a rock . i take these glasses off you ca n't tell the difference between me and a rock . i put these glasses on a rock . you know what jumps into most people 's minds ? costanza .
i change i change . two weeks ago i tried a soft boiled egg . never liked it before . now i 'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and i 'm loving it .
and i am not a piece of toast .
that 's okay . that 's good . you think louie pasteur and his wife had anything in common ? he was in the fields all day with the cows you know with the milk examining the milk delving into milk consummed with milk . pasteurization homogenization she was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand .
because . there was a lot of cake lying around the house . just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments
yes . yes . you know . she did n't know about pasteurization . he did n't know anout fumigation . but they made it work .
she comes out of the bathroom i 'm in up to my wrist . you should have seen the look on her face .
your buttocks are spectacular .
excuse me do you have a ticket ?
okay . good .
well if it 's as good as ``ponce de leon'' i 'll be happy .
``ponce de leon' ? but that was great .
lemme tell you sum'in . when ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he had n't changed and that tear started to roll down his cheek ? i lost it .
you 're not going to get back here in time .
i 'm in line to buy .
no it 's not it 's the ticket buyers line .
is this the ticket holders line or the buyers ?
but i asked you before if you had a ticket and you said no .
good . it 's good to be accurate like that .
it 's the same movie . what 's the difference ?
hey you know what else is playing here ? ``rochelle rochelle' .
i would n't mind seeing that .
so what 's your point ?
by the way you owe me seven fifty .
no i do n't have any change .
or i could take the twenty then i could pay you later .
might be easier .
either way .
so can i have it ?
whaddya mean you 'll ``get' the popcorn and the soda ?
i tell you what you give me the twenty and i will buy you a popcorn and soda and i 'll throw in a bon bons .
you go in and save seats .
well why do n't you go and i could save the seats . you said you did n't like saving anyway .
why do n't you give me the twenty and i 'll stop and get change and then you and i can uh you know settle .
psh . what 's the point of even discussing it ? you 'll give me the money when you have it . i i trust you .
um excuse me have you see a guy with like a horse face big teeth and a and a pointed nose ?
yeah .
uh i just went out i went to look for my friend ?

you mean that 's true i 'm right ? .
who 's he ?

why did n't kramer pick it up ?
oh yeah right . when 's he coming back ?
kramer goes to a fantasy camp . his whole life is a fantasy camp . people should plunk down two thousand dollars to live like him for a week . do nothing fall ass backwards into money mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating that 's a fantasy camp .
no no i do n't think so .

what do you need her for ? there 's a million lawyers .
alright alright but no funny business same deal as last night .
jerry please ?
till i 'm comfortable .
after consummation .
jerry ?
you think the person you were talking to is him ? that 's not even close to him . he 's funny jerry 's funny .
he ca n't not be funny .
dark and disturbed ? his whole life revolves around superman and cereal . i convinced him to act like that so that you would think i was funnier . that 's how disturbed i am . if you want disturbed that 's disturbed . you ca n't find sickness like that anywhere you think sickness like that grows on trees ? nobody is sicker than me nobody . he 's pretending i 'm the genuine article .
yes . and i put him up to it because i 'm sick . i 'm the one that needs help .
well should i call you later ?
but but i 'm disturbed . i 'm depressed . i 'm inadequate . i got it all .
it 's george .
she did n't help him ?
where is he ?
oh boy .
well last night she told me that she liked you . not you the disturbed you so i had to tell her the truth .
what do you mean i got ? you did n't give him his visa application .
wait a second wait a second and then the butler says i 'm not cleaning it up . i 'm sick of cleaning . '
i 'll tell you something i 've never seen a pilot script as funny as this .
i mean how funny is this ?
i mean we 're not stupid right ? we know when something 's funny .
okay . hey you know what maybe i should give it to my therapist to read . she 's smart i trust her .
hey you know we have n't brought the elaine character into the show yet . umm we should try and get her into this scene .
right
i do n't know what do women say ?
i do n't even know what they think . that 's why i 'm in therapy .
alright forget elaine .
hey .
yeah i feel like i 've grown .
great . oh by the way did you get a chance to read the script ?
well what 'd you think ?
you did n't like it ?
i ca n't believe this . what was wrong with it ? what did n't you like about it ?
it was n't funny ? what are you kidding ?
you did n't find it funny ? . this is what i 'm paying for ?
let me tell you who did uh buy it um we pitched this story to russell dalrymple the president of nbc and he ate it up with a spoon .
how 's this for criticism ? um you stink . how do like that criticism ? you know what 's funny to me ? that diploma up on the wall . that is my idea of com med dee' . you sitting here telling people what to do .
oh i 'm going baby . i 'm goin . it 's jerry 's fault . he took out all my good lines . he 's such a control freak .
so you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders and she criticizes our script . what kind of a therapist is that ?
oh she did n't think it was funny . what is she rowan & martin ? we 're supposed to meet with nbc tomorrow . she completely shattered my confidence . and i 'm paying for this she 's my employee .
and she slaves to earn every penny . so that someday i might be able to walk up to a woman and say yes i 'm bald but i 'm still a good person . '
no they do n't . i tried that once . i snubbed for a year . nothing . every woman i saw i snubbed . you never saw people so pleased .
hi .
my cousin worked for bouchardo s . they used to use the bouilla base for a toilet .
well you did n't hear it from me but needless to say if you go in there stick with the consumee .
aw that 's a fun age .
would you like a pepto bismol ? i keep them in my wallet . do you think he liked it ?
pasta primavera .
no .
so you were saying how um about the script
more jokes ?
a different name for the butler ?
we have n't heard his notes yet we do n't know how he feels about our work .
hi .
george .
he just read it .
so you live with your mother huh ?
divorce is very difficult . especially on a kid .
of course i 'm the result of my parents having stayed together so you never know .
you know suddenly i 'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself .
well it 's not my fault . you poked me .
it 's cleavage . i could n't look away . what am i waiting to win an oscar here ? this is all i have in my life .
all right . so he caught me in a cleavage peek so big deal . who would n't look at his daughter 's cleavage ? she 's got nice cleavage .
that 's why i peeked .
pasta primavera ?
from nbc ?
he poked me .
alright what 's the difference . what are we going to do now ? he wo n't take our calls we ca n't get into his office
hey now you 're onto something .
yeah . well maybe not elaine .
but somebody like gail though .
beautiful .
elaine this pilot it does n't matter to me it 's not me i 'm concerned about it 's my mother . i 've been over to the hospital to see her
never mind .
look who 's here .
pasta primavera . back on the horse .
did n't hear anything
oh uh because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter i really have to take issue with that . i did not leer . did i leer ?
because if i 'm looking straight ahead and something enters my field of vision that 's merely a happenstance .
this pasta primavera is fabulous .
great .
well it 's a funny idea .
c 'mon funny is funny .
yeah . where 's he taking you by the way ?
because of me ? you must be joking . who would n't want to live because of me ? i 'm nothing .
you can do better than me . you could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me . i 'm no good .
i 'm bad . i 'm bad .
so what could i do ? i could n't go through with it . she threatened to kill herself .
yes . why is that so inconceivable ?
i got two tickets to see guys and dolls .
what paper does she write for ?
lyndon johnson was uglier than degaulle .
so whaddya say ? you know you 'll always be the only man i 'll ever love .
c 'mon go along
i guess that leaves me in the clear
i just thought of a great name for myself if i ever become a porno actor .
yeah how did you know that ?
allison bought it for me .
i dunno . i guess i have to wait for her to die .
jerry did you wash this pear ?
it looks like it has n't been washed .
you hear the way he talks to me ?
let me ask you something . what do you think of this shirt ?
jerry said he did n't like it .
no you said you did n't like it
yeah . actually it was in gym class . i was trying to climb the ropes and jerry was spotting me . i kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally i slipped and fell on jerry 's head . we 've been close ever since .
no i got my own place .
my parents ? they do n't know what 's going on
no of course not
absolutely
my father is gay
look you want to have sex right now ? do want to have sex with me right now ? let 's go . c 'mon let 's go baby . c 'mon .
no .
hey .
so what did she say ?
y'know i could hear you on the other line
i heard what you said sharon are you there ? .
yes i heard you .
maybe she was n't . maybe she heard the whole conversation .
there may be a problem with the phone hold on' .
the phone 's a piece of junk goodbye' .
now she thinks we 're gay not that there 's anything wrong with it
y'know there are tribes in indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody 's house the families go to war .
not at all .
two tickets to guys and dolls' . i 'm going to go with you .
it 's guys and dolls' not guys and guys .
now everyone 's going to think we 're gay .
no not at all
hello ?
mrs . seinfeld ? . ?
oh my god . my mother .
it 's not true .
yeah . i 'm buck naked .
of course not
alright now the play is tomorrow night . so do you want to have dinner first or do you just want to meet at the theatre ?
no . just imagine her reaction .
oh my god
she has n't seen the article . when she sees it she 's going to think i 'm out baby . i 'm out .
yeah so ?
do n't you see what it says here ? do n't you understand what that 's implying ?
i 'm gay . i 'm a gay man . i 'm very very gay .
extraordinarily gay . steeped in gayness .
you do n't believe me ? ask jerry .
what do you mean you will ? that 's a bad idea . jerry is a very private person .
jerry . oh my god . what are you doing . ? .
you 're with a woman .
i leave you alone for two seconds and this is what you do . i trusted you .
alright tell her . go ahead .
y'know . about us .
alright i 'll tell you the truth . i 'm not gay . my name 's buck naked i 'm a porno actor .
oh what 's the point ? when i like them they do n't like me when they like me i do n't like them . why ca n't i act with the ones i like the same way i do with the ones i do n't like ?
maybe i need someone who does n't speak english .
a mute would be good .
this is what my life has come to tryin to meet a mute .
i dunno jerry somethin 's missing . there 's a void jerry there 's a void
there 's got to be more to life than this . what gives you pleasure ?
start what ?
really .
volunteer work huh ?
when did you get this idea ?
and and anybody can do this ?
helping people of course . of course . it makes perfect sense . how could i not be doing this . ? i am going to help somebody dammit .
what kind of a person are you ?
well i feel better already . i 'm feeling like a good person .
hey what 's your guy 's name again ?
ben cantwell . NUM . huh you think we 'll make it to that age ?
let me ask you something . what do you do for a living newman ?
are n't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody ?
y'know the average life span for an american male is like NUM . you 're really kinda pushing the envelope there .
you do n't ? boy i think about it a lot . i think about it at my age . imagine how much i 'll be thinking about it at your age . all i 'll do is keep thinking about it until it drives me insane
grateful ? how can you be grateful when you 're so close to the end ? when you know that any second poof . bamm o . it can all be over . i mean you 're not stupid you can read the handwriting on the wall . it 's a matter of simple arithmetic for gods sake
what are you talking about ? how can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you 're not worried ? . do n't you have any sense ? . do n't you have a brain . ? are you so completely senile that you do n't know what you 're talkin about anymore . ? .
wait a second where are you going ?
wait a minute please
but mr . cantwell you you owe me for the soup
i do n't think it 's going to work out
he fired me .
i dunno . i was just talking to the man and he walked out on me .
yeah i 'm a great quitter . it 's one of the few things i do well . i come form a long line of quitters . my father was a quitter my grandfather was a quitter i was raised to give up .
senegal ?
so you do n't speak any english at all ?
you do n't speak any english ?
i would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body . you do n't understand . it 's a miracle . you do n't understand because you do n't speak english .

what i do n't get is just because the battery is dead you think she 'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands .
i mean batteries have gone dead before are n't they prepared for that ?

he was definitely sniffing .
all right i got to get going . my parents are expecting me .

next friday what time ?
that 's my whole afternoon . i was going to look for sneakers .
i know a little . besides what do you have to know ?
do we have to ?
they are made from lycra spandex .
she does n't want to get a bra .
all right it would n't kill me .
yea i i know about the cups .
i know the d is the biggest . i 've based my whole life on knowing that the d is the biggest .
i got it . cups in the front loops in the back .
well that interests me very much mr . farkus . very much indeed sir .
no but um i have very good report with women very good comfortable . and from the first time i laid eyes on a brassieres i was enthralled .
well i was NUM years old . i was in my friends bathroom . his mother 's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and i picked it up studied it . i thought i like this . i did n't know what way or what level but i knew i wanted to be around brassieres .
well they 're more than an underwear to me mr . farkus . two cups in the front two loops in the back . how do they do it ?
thank you mr . farkus thank you very much indeed sir .
if you do n't mind sir . i 'll be here at NUM .
so long mr . farkus .
oh nothing
so what what is so bad about that ?
what about that spot i got ?
you open the door to the car boom you walk right into the hospital . eh you ca n't beat that spot . i am on a roll . i 'm just willing these great parking spots .
maybe the baby would like to see my spot . a positive uplifting message to start his life out with . huh you can still get a great space in this city if you apply yourself .
you got to look at this . i pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me .
kramer what the hell are you talking about ?
a pig man ?
hey why are all those people milling around my car ?
hey there 's a guy up the roof .
oh well i hope he does n't jum
my car . my caaaaarrrr .
well i just got the estimate . it 's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car 's worth so i 'm going over to see that hospital administrator today . someone is going to pay for this damage and it 's not going to be me .
i know swan dives from twenty floors up lands right on top . what do i got a bulls eye up there ? he could n't move over two feet ? land on the sidewalk . it 's city property .
i tell you something . i wish there were pig men . you get a few of these pig men walking around suddenly i 'm looking a whole lot better . then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say hey he 's no pig man . '
but kramer is n't it a question of hygiene ?
yeah . so how does that help me ?
yeah my roommate in college .
i got used to it .
alright the administrator 's on the third floor . i 'll meet you guys back at the car .
the pig man can take the bus .
how do you know ? what if pig man had a two seater ?
i 'll tell you what if pig man shows up we 'll squeeze him in . i 'll see you later .
well i join them in their grief .
that 's where i come in . umm on splat . uh you see mrs . sweedler or is it hospital administrator sweedler ?
mrs . sweedler thank you . y you see this tragedy affected me in a very very personal way .
yes well you see the deceased landed on my car . the uh splat as it were actually occurred on the roof of my car . now of course i ca n't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but i 've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything .
yes but then everything is all pulled down and it 's jus anyway . the damage unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undriveable .
yes a shame . that is exactly how i would put it . now mrs . sweedler with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation i just ca n't help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still living victim of horrendous horrendous tragedy .
yes .
yes .
well profit . i think you 'll see from the estimate that i 'm not really profiting that much . they might be a little high but
should i leave this ?
so uh been to a bris before ?
i 've been to a few of em . if you uh start to get woozy later which is quite common stay close to me . i 'll get you through it .
oh .
no no .
alright alright .
it was very traumatic . the last thing i remember is you flinching . then everything went black .
be careful you 're getting blood all over the car .
hey look a that boy are you lucky another great spot right in front of the hospital . in an emergency yet . how lucky are you huh ? is that unbelievable ? how unbelievable is that huh ? come on give it to me give it to me .
i have never seen a mohel like that .
wha where is he going ?
it 's a NUM chevy impala . they stole it right in front of the hospital . i saw the guy drive off in it . well he 's about five feet tall hairless pink complexion looks like a pig . yeah alright alright thank you thank you . so any word from the pig man ?
no . and he 's not a pig man is he ?
where 's the sunblock ?
NUM ? you do n't have anything higher ?
i need higher . this has paba in it i need paba free .
yes i have a problem with paba .
i know enough to stay away from it .
so are you going to toddo s party this weekend ?
gwen really wants to go .
no good ?
why 'd you pick hoover ? was he that interesting to talk to ?
yeah i guess . what can i do ? i got to take her with me . todd introduced us i 'm obligated .
who the croat ?
yeah she 's a b . l .
beautiful lineswoman . alright listen uh i 'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock . you want anything ? jerry ? jerry ?
boy you are really smitten .
cold ? how are you going to do that ? you 're not one of those guys .
they 're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side .
wait a minute jerry there 's a bigger issue here . if you go through that wall and become one of those guys i 'll be left here on this side . take me with you .
what are you going to say ?
you think you 're going to the other side with hi ? you 're not going to make it .
i do n't understand things were going so great . what happened ? something must have happened .
you 're giving me the it 's not you it 's me routine ? i invented it 's not you it 's me . nobody tells me it 's them not me if it 's anybody it 's me .
you 're damn right it 's me .
i know what you were trying to do . nobody does it better than me .
yes well unfortunately you 'll never get the chance to find out .
yeah so did i .
no . she tried to give me the it 's not you it 's me routine .
yeah . well aparently wordo s out .
really ? at the tennis match ?
get out of here . i did n't see any cameras there .
cracks ? what were they saying ?
oh my god maybe gwen saw it . maybe that 's what did it .
she must have seen me eating it on tv .
why not . i would be .
you 're parents saw me on tv ?
this is nighmare . kramer how long was i on ?
one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand .
can we move on ?
yes i do .
well i ca n't now gwen 's going to be there .
to the victor goes the spoils . what are you going to do tonight ?
oh .
well i was just going to wander the streets . do n't want to tag along with you or anything .
jerry please that 's very nice but uh where would we be going ?
so i 've got ice cream all over my face . there were no napkins there . whoever it was that 's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship .
they 're breaking up ? how do you know ?
what are they saying now ?
oh my gosh i just had a great idea . she could come to the party tomorrow and read gwen 's lips for me .
we bring her to the party and she can tell me what gwen is saying about me .
look . it 's a skill just like juggling . she probably enjoys showing it off .
could you ask her just ask her . if she says no case closed .
she confused six with sex ?
well if she ca n't tell six from sex then how is she going to lip read from across the room ?
it 's two completely different sounds . ih and eh .
it seems like a problem .
oh when is that car service coming ?
if this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be ? it 's like having superman for your friend .
if we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain there 'd be no stopping us .
what ?
ah .
hey hey .
why ? did she say something to you about why she broke up with me ?
really ?
i would n't hear of it todd . it 's none of my business . but you should try to find out everything you possibly can . in fact i 'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there 's no chance of me overhearing anything .
hey grown up . oh my god there she is . go ahead go ahead . let 's go let 's go . all right what are they saying ?
wheret ?
what ?
alright that 's it . so you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together ?
i heard your whole conversation .
i can read lips . you said let 's sleep together .
sweep ?
cut it .
cut it .
cut it . would you stop signing ?
she said sweep together you idiots not sleep together .
ow . my eye my eye .
fantastic .
good .
very good .
ya see how could this not have any fat ? it 's too good .
oh you want to taste mine .
lo k if you want to taste mine you do n't have to offer me some of yours .
what do you mean ?
no kidding ?
oh god . look who 's here .
this guy from my old neighborhood . lloyd braun . he 's a big advisor to mayor dinkins . he thinks he 's so cool .
hey hay . lloyd . hey . my friend jerry eh .
yeah there was a fire in my apartment .
uh uh yeah . actually the uh i i bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an now it sort of moves involuntarily .
oh pretty good .
yeah this is my first time here .
uh elaine this is uh lloyd .
yeah . yeah .
he 's a jerk .
all right . all right .
no .
what 's for supper ?
hey lloyd . how 's it going ?
oh it 's good .
nothing .
yeah .
well it comes and goes .
you know lloyd i i 've been to the doctor there 's really nothing they can do .
all right . all right . i 'll go .
oh uh just a friend of mine .
oh you know lloyd i really do n't have it .
yeah .
so he made an appointment for me to see dinkins doctor . he 's just trying to humiliate me .
and i have to go . if i do n't go he 'll know i 'm lying .
i do n't care . look lloyd does n't know what he 's up against . this is nothing to me . my whole life is a lie .
hey
oh do n't tell me . lloyd ?
oh look he 's going to ask you about my arm . so just tell him i banged it against a desk . and it 's been moving involuntarily ever since .
why not ?
so you 're taking his side ?
already you 're marrying this guy ?
all right believe me you 're not going to marry him .
yeah yeah . big advisor .
the next morning i woke up and it was going like this . i can control it if i really concentrate . but otherwise oh .
please doctor .
yes .
uh huh .
hmm . really ? nothing ?
well it 's kind of a mystery is n't it ?
how so ?
faking ? what makes you think that i have time to see doctors take x rays make appointments when there 's absolutely nothing wrong with me ? what kind of a person would do a thing like that ?
now see here doctor .
fine . ow .
name tags . name tags . what kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that .
i banged it on the desk in the doctor 's office . an aaaa . . .
phew .
well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious .
i enjoy understanding .
i want you to have this job . of course
that 's it .
he never finished the sentence . he got a call that was the end of the interview .
maybe he was going to say of course i have to check with my associates .
all right .
because he made a big deal about how i understand everything immediately . that 's what impressed him .
and if i do n't call
rest stop supply .
hey
i had a job interview .
good . of course
he massacred you .
you look like you 're five years old .
you 've got to start seeing someone else . get out of this relationship .
well you got to do it .
so i still have n't heard about that job .
i have an idea .
i show up .
i show up . i pretend i have the job . the guy 's on vacation . if i have the job it 's fine . if i do n't have the job by the time he comes back i 'm ensconced .
what 's the worst thing that could happen ?
yeah so ?
good morning . good morning . good morning . hi nice to see you . how are you . good morning . good morning .
the name 's george constanza . i 'm starting work here today . i was wondering if you could tell me where my office is .

oh well he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation .
oh leave jack alone . jack 's got enough problems . i 'll just take the small office .
yes . i like to feel cozy . i have a very small apartment . i like to feel tucked in nestled in . love to be nestled .
yes yes of course . the pensky file . ho ho ca n't wait to sink my teeth into that . wow that pensky . well we 'll straighten him out .
they gave me the pensky file .
you know i 'm enjoying it very much . i think my coworkers are really taking to me .
i feel like a family . in fact yesterday was grace 's birthday . she 's such a sweet woman so we had a little party with cake and champagne . i made a toast .
he 'll be back on monday .
you know elaine i 'd do it but i 'm working that day .
mr . pensky ? of the pensky file ?
mr . pensky . i was just working on your file . i was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion style folder .
he 's on vacation .

you are aware that pensky is interested in me .
really ? well we 'll just see about that . ta ta tut tle .
obviously .
so i go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this low cut thing . so i said to her can i ask you a question ? when you put on a top like that what 's your tought process ? what 's going on in your mind ?
you 're listening to this ?
well nothing . i did n't actually say that .
sweetheart i was exaggerating .
you know it 's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket .
well i 've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard and fast rules . darling the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart .
jody let 's do this agian real soon
so what do you think ?
jody 's nice .
you think she liked me ? she seemed to like me .
i was personable . do n't you think i was personable ?
i tought i picked up a little something . i 'm very good at this . did you pick up anything ?
the second time i sent the noodles back i tought she made a face
i tought i saw a face .
no difference . i could care less . she 's jerry 's girlfriend .
he he he he
so you think she likes me ?
she stayed over ?
the sex was n't so good ?

whatever . believe me if i was n't involved right now i would n't mind being set up . something tells me she 's a knockout .
so i lugged that table . that big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab . you ever seen one of those things ?
no i do n't know . maybe you have n't . you know not everybody 's seen a massage table .

i do n't even drink wine . i drink pepsi .
why not ?
you telling me that wine is better than pepsi ? huh no way wine is better than pepsi .
i just do n't like the idea that any time there 's a dinner invitation there 's this annoying little chore that goes along with it .
hehehehehe
oh yeah . you wish you had this coat .
oh here we go
why do n't we get them a couch ? we 'll rent a u haul we 'll bring em a nice sectional .

newspaper .
clark bar .
we 're up to two dollars here .
i 'm not getting a penthouse forum .

yes i 'm sorry it 's a new coat . it it 's gore tex .
all right we got the wine . are n't we lucky ? we got wine . whoopee whoa . imagine if we did n't bring the wine . we 'd be shunned by society . outcasts . where 's your wine ? get out .
l look at this ?
somebody double parked and blocked us in . d does anybody know whose car that is ? maybe there 's a note on it . ohh oh brother . no no note . can you believe this ?
i really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes . can you comprehend it ?
i mean we can put a man on the moon but we 're still basically very stupid . the guy who 's car this is ? he could be one of the guys that built the rocket . you see what i 'm saying ?
so you really understand my point about building a rocket and double parking .
maybe it 's not even stupidity . maybe it 's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency . yeah this how dictator 's start . do you think mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot ?
i 'll tell you if i was running for office i would ask for the death penalty for double parkers . if this is allowed to go on this is not a society . this is anarchy .
no not really .
i know that 's why i bought `em but they 're not comfortable .
we are really late now . we 're in big trouble . big trouble .
you know elaine .
. . . i 'm a little scared of her .
yes .
did you ever see her lose her temper . i was once late cause i bought a panama hat she grabbed it by the brim pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it .
why did n't you just wear a heavier coat ?
oh hey hey hey . that 's great . that 's very nice . you know we 've been waiting twenty minutes for you people ? . what do you think you 're mussolini ? .
i was n't talking to you .
do you think chickens have individual personalities ?
if you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted ? or would they all just be walking around ? bak bak baak bak ? cause if they have individual personalities i 'm not sure we should be eaten `em . what 's the matter with you ?
oh no no no we bought the wine here before but now you know we 're bl blocked in by some car double parked and we 're just waiting for the guy to pull out .
but my friend here has hypothermia .
you know that coat was gore tex . it 's worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap chardonnay .
i 'm cold too . at least you 've got a coat . let 's get in the car .
oh my god that 's saddam hussein . the dictator .
s s somebody double parked we could n't help it . it might have been saddam hussein we 're not really sure . he eh had a british accent though .
what what happened to you ?
i had to give it to the liquor store guy .
i spilled some chardonnay . so what did you get ?
cinnamon ? why did n't cha get chocolate ?
and your wine .
you ca n't handle the truth .
i 'm working on my jack nicholson you ca n't handle the truth .
yeah i grabbed it on the way out i do n't want my mother reading it .
yeah .
no anything .
she 'll open .
yes .
i was curious .
maybe i can get her locked up .
hey did you see that whale thing on tv last night ?
i am such a huge whale fan . these marine biologists were showing how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals what a fish .
whatever . hey new tape recorder ?
hey .
i do .
i 'm just saying i want to have some fun .
come on . ya want to go get some lunch ?
yeah i 'm going to get a paper .
keep your head down .
diane deconn ? you saw diane deconn .
ahh . how 'd she look ?
ahh . umh .
she asked about me ? what did what did she say ?
george . she said george ? she remembered my name . diane deconn remembered my name . she was the it girl .
ok i 'm telling you right now if your kidding around i 'm not going to be able to be your friend anymore . i 'm serious about that . you got that .
good . cause if this is a lie if this is a joke if this is your idea of some cute little game we 're finished .
oh my god he 's not kidding .
a what ?
a marine biologist ?
why am i a marine biologist ?
but i 'm not a marine biologist .
so ?
i did n't even know it was a job .
well what if she calls me ? what am i supposed to say ? .
algae obviously plankton hmhm . i do n't know what else i could tell ya ah oh i i just got back from a trip to the galapagos islands i was living with the turtles .
i do n't know what'cha had to tell her that for . you put me in a very difficult position marine biologist . i 'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing .
well it 's not up my alley . it 's one thing if i make it up . i know what i 'm doin i know my alleys . you got me in the galapagos islands living with the turtles i do n't know where the hell i am .
look why could n't you make me an architect ? you know i always wanted to pretend that i was an architect . well i i 'm supposed to see her tomorrow i i i 'm going to tell her what 's goin on . i mean maybe she just likes me for me .
how 'd she find it ?
then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today .
yeah but if you still look closely you can see ah a little bump where the nose use to be . huhuhuhu .
but enough about fish huhuhu . i can discuss other things you know ah architecture . huhu .
oh they 're busting .
so i started to walk into the water . i wo n't lie to you boys i was terrified . but i pressed on and as i made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me . i i do n't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but i tell you jerry at that moment i was a marine biologist .
i know i was just telling them the story .
the sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli .
i got about fifty feet out and suddenly the great beast appeared before me . i tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot . as if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow . i said easy big fella . and then as i watched him struggling i realized that something was obstructing its breathing . from where i was standing i could see directly into the eye of the great fish .
whatever .
well then from out of nowhere a huge tidal wave lifted me tossed like a cork and i found myself right on top of him face to face with the blow hole . i i i could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but i knew something was there so i reached my hand in felt around and pulled out the obstruction .

ohh yes yes . yes jerry they were all over me . it was like rocky NUM hm . diane came up to me threw her arms around me
kissed me . we both had tears streaming down our faces . i never saw anyone so beautiful . it was at that moment that i decided to tell her that i was not a marine biologist .
told me to go to hell . and i took the bus home .
sand . it 's everywhere
did she say why ?
maybe she 's diabetic .
maybe you said something that offended her .
like at the airport ?
that 's a great idea .
we could be zipping all over the place .
they never try anything .
no harm .
well i ca n't walk anywhere now . i 'm just going to be wishing there were walkways . what are you doing ?
kramer what 's the name of the store with the mannequin ?
wait a minute rinitze ? do n't they have somme really cool suits in there ?
i 'm going to go with you . i got to get a new suit . i got a second interview with mackenzie and i think i 'm really close . they 're all taking me out to lunch on friday .
all right . all right .
it 's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body . do n't fall asleep elaine .
whoa look at this . this is a beautiful suit . huh ?
you think so ?
you really think this looks ok on me ?
ah pfft . what can you do ? is this the price tag ?
yes hello . party 's over .
so you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me ?
oh yes of course and we have to be fair .
what 's this ? ca n't i leave this place for a second ? can i help you ?
no no no this suit is not for sale .
no .
look i 'm doing you a favor . they 're having an unadvertised sale . this suit is going to be half priced starting monday .
yea yea yea
yes . now take off those pants .
you know honey for an unadvertised sale you 're doing a lot of yapping about it .
why did n't you just tell her ?

yeah just like i do .
well i think poppie 's got some problems . there 's a whole other thing going on with poppie . so how did you leave it ?
olive ?
oh .
i got to get downtown and buy that suit . the store opens in twenty minutes .
yeah .
the last time i saw her she was naked .
well look at this . this does n't belong here . someone has made a terrible mistake .
hid ? i have no idea how this suit got misplaced . nevertheless i do believe i shall purchase it .
oh i 'll pay . half price . arrivederci my fellow NUM short .
you 're telling me . so what do you think ?
i probably did n't hear it on the way over because of the street noise . this is no good . i got to meet these guys from mackenzie for lunch in half an hour .
this mackenzie he 's a bit of a nut . someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed .
let 's say it comes down to me and one other guy . he 's got a nice quiet suit and i 'm whooshing all over the place . who do you think he 's going to hire ?
no i did n't hear anything .
no ca n't say as i did .
could be the leaves
i heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted .
no problem there . conformity is an obsession with me .
oh
no . but i was the only one at the table that did n't get violently ill .

i did n't even know fulton was in the hospital .
na no i 'm not good in these situations . i ca n't hide my pity . i i make em feel worse .
ya and also i 'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me . you know they got nothing to lose what do they care ?
no but say hello for me .
hi nice to meet you .
you got a job ?
ca n't you just switch with another midget ?

daphne . i have to tell you something this is very difficult
ya ya . i bumped into him on the bus . what did he have to say ?
what ?
he said that ? what a nerve . how dare he say something like that .

ya
this you are not going to believe . al netchie that pimple . tells daphne not get this not to get involved with me . '
ya . that 's what she told me .
because he 's afraid she 's going to get hurt .
of course .
wa he does n't have to tell her .
oh no no no . he 's deeply in love and i was just about to break up with her when she told me .
well i ca n't break up with her now .
because he said i was going to .
yes i am .
i do n't see any way around it .
what choice do i have ?
you know what . i do n't think i 'm going to be able to stay over tonight .
i i really should go home . ya actually i 'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow we 're uh we 're going to a father son picnic just the two of us .
well dado s been planning this for such a long time he bought a new blanket and he got tha that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball .

you said the guy gave you an open lipped kiss .
well that does n't mean anything .
well what about the open lipped kiss ?
yeah you 're right you 're right . alright maybe he 's not interested but you still know him ca n't you just ask him ?
why ?
aha . aha . could it be because you do n't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower is that it ? .
oh i think it is . i think that 's exactly what it is .
i was there . i saw a drain .
it 's all pipes . what 's the difference ? .
i 'll call a plumber right now .
what happened ? did he bring it up ?
signal ? what signal ?
i 'll tell you what that is that 's a violation of club rules . now i got him . and you 're my witness .
a guy leaves a puddle of sweat that 's a signal ?
what if he left you a used kleenex what 's that a valentine ? now you go up to him and you tell him that if he 's thinking of turning me in that i got the goods on him .
so you 're going to let me get suspended for shower urination ?

it 's a spanish dish . it 's a moulage of fish an meat with rice . very tasty .
hey could you do one other thing for me ?
you think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to paris with them ? it turns out that the kido s father lives in paris . is that a coincidence ? eh you know alec wants me to take him over there so i figure as long as they 're going
alright if you think it 's too much they do n't have to mail the postcards .
they were drinking champaign in a buggy .
yea
the thing that bothers me the most is the lying .

ah .
the attic ? y you have n't wore any of those clothes for years .
it 's the remote .
i 'm trying to buy some of the clothes back . hey you want to come over for dinner tonight ? my mother made all this extra paella .

honesty hard work these are the values that i was raised on . the most important thing joey is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night .
where the hell is your father ? .
ow . what are you doing under there ? hey stop that . do n't eat that . that 's not food . he 's sucking down equal packets .
NUM kids for his birthday party ? do n't put your tongue on the floor . he 's putting his tongue on the floor . here here have some more sugar packets .
how about bozo ?
who 's bozo ? bozo the clown that 's who bozo is . when i was a kid bozo the clown was the clown bar none .
with the orange hair and the big clown shirt with the ruffles
he had a tv show . he had cartoons .
you know when i was a kid we did n't have these elaborate birthday parties w with catered food and entertainment . i remember my NUM birthday party

it was an inferno in there . an inferno .
i was trying to lead the way . we needed a leader . someone to lead the way to safety .
because . because as the leader if i die then all hope is lost . who would lead ? the clown ? instead of castigating me you should all be thanking me . what kind of a topsy turvy world do we live in where where heroes are cast as villains ? brave men as cowards ?
seemingly . seemingly to the untrained eye i can fully understand how you got that impression . what looked like pushing what looked like knocking down was a safety precaution . in a fire you stay close to the ground am i right ? and when i ran out that door i was not leaving anyone behind . oh quite the contrary . i risked my life making sure that exit was clear . any other questions ?
its not easy .
so she does n't want to see me anymore .
no her too . and her mother .
yeah . i may have stepped on her arm too i do n't know .
yeah . but it was somebody 's arm .
to some degree .
in a manner of speaking .
yeah . she should be commending me for treating everyone like equals .
perhaps .
yeah . eric the clown put it out with his big shoe .
what 's that ?
wow he really does a number on you . seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling . '
you know what you oughta do . you should go to her office and heckle her .
you know like all the comedians always say how would you like it if i came to where you work and heckled you ? '
i 'm not kidding you should do it .
well go ahead . do it .
no reason .

robin ? robin .
robin listen to me . the most amazing thing has happened . kramer has opened my eyes . i think i 've changed .
o . k
you 'll see things will be different now if you just give me one more chance .
alright but i 'm serious about this .
he 's got a gun . he 's got a gun . get out of the way .
the prop comic ? oh hi i did n't recognize you what did you get a haircut ?
i never tasted a cough medicine i did n't love .
you see ? we were made for each other . it 's amazing . if i reach out and touch her breast right not she 'd scream and throw me out of the car . but at this time tomorrow i could touch it all i want .
potussan . ever try it with club soda ?
oh very refreshing . sex is like joining a private club . i 'll be the same me tomorrow but suddenly the no trespassing sign will be gone .
yeah about ten fifteen minutes . but i have to stop at a vegetable stand .
my mother loves hampton tomatoes . she 's nuts for hampton tomatoes .
you know when i was a kid i once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool .
yeah . hey you know i got to go get these tomatoes . you want to go for a ride ?
kay . i 'll uh i 'll see you later . anybody want some tomatoes ?
hey rachel .
what kind of a greeting was that ?
yeah . i love hampton tomatoes . you know you can eat em like apples . you know it 's funny the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit .
hey . wow the k man .
this is fantastic . man what a weekend . swimming lobster for dinner
you saw who what ?
you saw jane topless ?
oh you mean face down on her chest .
face up on her back ?
well why 'd she do that ?
you mean she just laid there topless ?
walked around ? and you looked ?
i ca n't believe that you saw her before me .
well how good a look did you get ?
well if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist
great great . so anytime you want you can just visualize her naked .
stop it stop it . it 's not fair . it 's not fair . i do n't like this situation jerry . i do n't like it one bit .
yes yes . the punishment should fit the crime .
it 's like i 'm neil armstrong . i turn around for a sip of tang and you jump out first .
oh okay .
oh sorry .
i 'm sorry uh it 's not like i 'm going to see something i 've never seen before .
i did n't .
no i was just wondering if you guys uh had any gum .
yes because the water was cold and the chewing warms me up .
okay . thanks anyway .
i was in the pool . i was in the pool .
did she do it on purpose ?
i was supposed to see her . she was n't supposed to see me .
well ordinarily i would n't mind . but
well i just got back from swimming in the pool . and the water was cold
yes . significant shrinkage .
yes . i mean if she thinks that 's me she 's under a complete misapprehension . that was not me jerry . that was not me .
what if she discusses it with jane ?
how do you know ?
they 're worse . they 're much worse than us they talk about everything . could n't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor ?
how do women know about shrinkage ?
do women know about shrinkage ?
no .
it just does .
see look at this . rachel my t shirt shrunk . it used to be much bigger and now it shrunk . you see that 's what water does . it shrinks things .
what 're you doing ? what 're you telling secrets ? what 're you laughing at ?
you know it 's very impolite to tell secrets . are you talking about me ?
you 're going back to new york now ?
uh huh . uh huh . i think you spoke to your little friend rachel that 's what i think .
and she did n't say something to you about a certain something ?
i think that you think that a certain something is not all that it could be when in fact it is is all that it should be and more .
look you do n't understand . there was shrinkage .
well i 'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host .
a little breakfast .
and uh you eat eggs right ?
ah enjoying them ?
uh good . you know you might want to try eating it with one of these .
not that much . you know they tend to shrink in the water .
ah i guess i should go up and apologize .
i do n't know why rachel had to drive back with michael and carol .
hey there 's a tomato stand let 's stop i can get some more .
where ?
i went to the beach .
it 's not working jerry . it 's just not working .
why did it all turn out like this for me ? i had so much promise . i was personable i was bright . oh maybe not academically speaking i was perceptive . i always know when someone 's uncomfortable at a party .
it became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision i 've ever made in my entire life has been wrong . my life is the complete opposite of everything i want it to be . every instinct i have in every of aspect of life be it something to wear something to eat it 's all been wrong . everywhere .
yeah . no no no wait a minute i always have tuna on toast . nothing 's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast . i want the complete opposite of on toast . chicken salad on rye un toasted with a side of potato salad and a cup of tea .
good for the tuna .
so what ? what am i supposed to do ?
elaine bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents do n't approach strange women .
yeah i should do the opposite i should .
yes i will do the opposite . i used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day so now i will do the opposite and i will do something .
excuse me uh i could n't help but notice that you were looking in my direction .
my name is george . i 'm unemployed and i live with my parents .
why shave every day ? it just grows right back .
i 'm afraid i 'm just not interested in how i present myself . if those kind of superficialities are important to you this probably is n't going to work .
take it easy . take it easy . it 's not the end of the world .
that wo n't be necessary .
shut your traps and stop kicking the seats . we 're trying to watch the movie . and if i have to tell you again we 're going to take it outside and i 'm going to show you what it 's like . you understand me ? now shut your mouths or i 'll shut em for ya and if you think i 'm kidding just try me . try me . because i would love it .
i do n't think we should . we really do n't know each other very well .
i 'm the opposite of every guy you 've ever met .
hey i just found twenty dollars . i tell you this something is happening in my life . i did this opposite thing last night . up was down black was white good was
day was
yes .
yes . and listen to this listen to this her uncle works for the yankees and he 's going to get me a job interview . a front office kind of thing . assistant to the traveling secretary . a job with the new york yankees . this has been the dream of my life ever since i was a child and it 's all happening because i 'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment i have had . this is no longer just some crazy notion . elaine jerry this is my religion .
yes funny let 's go .
alrighty . ah my last job was in publishing i uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman .
ah alright before that i was in real estate . i quit because the boss would n't let me use his private bathroom . that was it .
of course .
i am different yeah .
well i wish i could say the same but i must say with all due respect i find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization . in the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of new york a good deal of distress as we have watched you take our beloved yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock all for the glorification of your massive ego .
the new york yankees .
i 'm the assistant to the travelling secretary . i 'm going on the road trips with em . i 'll be on the plane i 'm working in yankee stadium . this is a dream i 'm busting jerry i 'm busting .
ya .
and i 'm moving out of my parents house i 'm taking that apartment on NUM street remember the one we saw ?
i 'm back in business baby .
hey .
well you could move in with my parents .
instinct .
yeah it 's the last one .
alright let 's go .
i 'm not going to be nice . that 's how i got the job .
i just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me and i love you both very very much .
greetings people . greetings . greetings and salutations . what a beautiful day for a ball game . let 's play two . oh i 'll have the chicken salad on rye my usual you know what i get darling . so let 's see i had a little conversation today with mr don mattingly he 's the first base man .
we talked about his new batting stance you know i 'm not crazy about it but i said donny go with it till it stops working . donny baseball . he 's a helluva guy .
ok danny take a swing . n no . no . no . you 're opening up your shoulder .
no not really . i 'm just saying this to you because i like to hear myself talk . yes really .
what are all sweating for ?
hot ? what is this ?
this uniform what 's it made from ?
no . this is not cotton . here lemme see . will you stop it ? oh . of course . polyester .
i ca n't believe you 're not playing in cotton .
you know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric ?
of course . alright maybe i 'll say something to buck .
hey do n't embarrass me today . i got some friends in the stands .
miss rhode island ? when are you seeing her ?
you 're incredible .
what if she becomes miss america ? you could be dating miss america jerry .
chaperone ? what are you kidding ?
what does the chaperone do ?
can she talk ?
you 're calling her ?
hey did you know that the yankees do n't wear cotton jerseys ?
well what is that ? that 's a crime . do you know how hot those things get ? they should be wearing cotton .
i do n't know . that 's all going to change .
why should n't i ?
how do you know ?
hey buck . talk to you for a second ?
how 's everything going ? everything ok ?
listen buck i uh obviously i do n't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale but uh i 've been talking to some of the guys and some of them i do n't want to mention any names but some of them they 're not too happy with the polyester uniforms .
well they get very hot in the polyester . you know it 's not a natural fibre . i think they would prefer cotton .
yeah . cotton breathes you see it 's much softer . imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team . do n't you think that would be an advantage ? they 're cooler they 're more comfortable they 're happier they 're going to play better .
oh i 've got something .
well did you see it ?
the uniforms . did you see how they played ? listen to these comments . wade boggs what a fabric . finally we can breathe . luis palonia cotton is king . paul o'neill i never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy .
hey where ya goin ?
really .
atlantic city ? yes . yes . i will go to atlantic city . i 'm in . i 'm down .
hey .
how was the show ?
i won fifty bucks . boy this is great . too bad elaine 's not here .
i do n't know it sounds like pigeons or something .
me either . is there anything you can do to shut them up ?
good night stan .
what was that all about ?
oh .
that 's a shame .
hey hey . yankee game .
hey hey .
elaine julie .
hey want to get some lunch ?
ah well that 's very mature . what about you ?
sure all right what do you want ?
what big salad ? i 'm going to the coffee shop .
i 've never seen a big salad .
is that what i ask for ? the big salad ?
no no hey i 'll get it . what 's in the big salad ?
we 'll see you in a little while .
oh safire . uh ha
he can be pedantic . he can be pedantic .
yes . yes . you know what 's interesting . the quarterback for the atlanta falcons is bobby hebert . no r which i find fascinating . you know it 's herbert h e r b e r t hebert h e b e r t . hebert it 's a fun name to pronounce . try and say it hebert . take a shot . all right . all right . i
no julie julie do n't insult me . you know what difference does it make who pays for lunch . it 's totally meaningless .
hey hey .
no you go guggenheim . i 'm not much of a guggenheim .
ya you go .
did you see what just happened ?
did you happen to notice that julie handed the big salad to elaine ?
well she did n't buy the big salad . i bought the big salad .
yes it is . she just took credit for my salad . that 's not right .
i mean i 'm the one who bought it .
you think she should have said something ?
oh i know .
you know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it .
yeah she 's very lovely .
so did you enjoy your lunch ?
oh . . . because she handed you the bag . i could have handed you the bag . she happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though . . .
. . . naw it 's just you thanked her and and oh . . . what 's the difference ?
it 's just that i was the one who actually paid for the big salad . she just happened to hand it to you . but it 's no big deal .
no no
there is no problem . . . just a small miscommunication . whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad .
you know i think i could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house . it seems like fun to me . it does n't seem like a gender thing . i think i would like to play with dolls . what 's so terrible ?
a ha . we 're just friends .
oh share .
ha ha ha uh i 'm not following that .
well she probably just assumed .
. . . uh . . . wait a second . are you suggesting that i went out of my way to tell elaine that even though you handed her the big salad that it came from me ?
. . . well it was a big salad . and what i would like to know is how does a person who has nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretenses ah ah ?
you know if it was a regular salad i would n't have said anything . but you had to have the big salad .
the rule is a minimum of two days .
i 'm making it up .
oh well a mantel 's a whole different story .
if my parents had a mantel i might be a completely different person .
let 's have it .
you want me to ask one of the yankees .
alright . i 'll run it by a few people .
who was flirting with you ?
she was n't flirting with you .
really ?
he probably does n't want to get chocolate on his fingers . that 's the way these society types eat their candy bars .
what you think i eat all my meals with you ? excuse me sweetheart ? i think you may have overcharged us . what is this ?
got it . did you just see what happened here ?
did you see the way she pointed at the check ? she gave me the finger .
so what do you think ?
channel eleven ? forgive me for trying to class up this place for trying to have the yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven .
i am eating my dessert . how do you eat it with your hands ?
you wanted a yankee i got you a yankee .
hey the bull owes me one i helped him with his swing .
absolutely . pending approval of the script .
jerry i 'm yankee management .
hey when you order from the waitress get her to point to the menu . i want to see what finger she uses .
i did n't get the special but i 'd also like the fresh fruit too .
i do n't believe it she did it again .
she had an itch . she could have used any one of those fingers . that finger was meant for me .
oh no in and out i made sure of that . and you 'll be happy to know i perused the script and it 's met with my approval .
hey . watch it . did you see that guy ? he just gave me the finger .
oh yeah . middle finger straight up at me . at us .
i 'm following him .
no one gives us the finger . we 're yankees .
no you can have it .
i 'll take care of this danny .
excuse me .
i believe you cut me off and then made an obscene gesture .
outside of manhattan about an hour ago .
that 's right of the new york yankees .
hey it 's george . i got nothing to say
hey hey hey . you do n't call me back ? .

imagine if i had to see them both on the same day ? haha . it 's like running a double marathon .
you know what this has to do with ?
the man in the cape i bet you he is mixed up in this . i do n't trust men in capes .
all right superman 's the exception .
all right . let me just say one thing there is no way that this is going to happen . you hear me ? no way . because if you think i 'm going to two thanksgivings you 're out of your mind .
you did ? . that 's goood . that 's very good . i 'm very glad to hear that .
all right . so let me ask you a question . who was the man in the cape ?
your lawyer wears a cape ?
who wears a cape ?
all right . come on . let 's not fight .
ehh . so what made you change your mind ?
what ? .

you are going to love this car . even if you do n't like jon voight .
what do you mean might ? you do n't think he really owned this car ?
well why would the guy make up something like that ? of all the names he could pick why settle on jon voight ?
neeson ? how are you comparing liam neeson with jon voight ? jerry we 're talking about joe buck . if you can play joe buck oskar schindler 's a cake walk .
whoa whoa you 're not getting in my car with gummy shoes .
liam neeson . you know he 's not american .
everybody 's talking at me i ca n't hear a word they 're saying just driving around in jon voight 's car

well there 's going to be a lot of dentists there .
you do n't want to suffer with this all weekend .

jerry for all i know this guy went out of his way to not invite you . how am i going to feel if i show up with an uninvited unwelcome intruder ?
jon voight . are you kidding me ? did you talk to him ?
what you did n't ask him about the car ?
jon voight bit you ?
he left perfect imprints .
wait a minute wait it 's not that stupid .

yeah and now someone 's going to be taking messages for me .
sure . i could go the tomato route . but eh i 've given this a lot of thought jerry . all that frustration . i 'll never get any work done . so i 'm doing a complete NUM . i 'm going for total efficiency and ability .
whatever .
well miss coggins you 're ah obviously qualified for the job . you 've all the necessary skills and experience . but you 're extremely attractive . you 're gorgeous . i 'm looking at you i ca n't even remember my name . so ah i 'm afraid this is not going to work out thanks for coming in .
you 're luscious . you 're ravishing . i would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra . i 'm terribly sorry .
i ca n't imagine .
hey hey .
hey elaine . i 'm telling you jerry having a secretary is incredible . i do n't know why i did n't have one before .
perhaps . i walk in everything is organized messages appointments . and i ca n't tell you how proud i am of myself for going with ade .
you arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli .
well wha 'd you buy it for ?
demi ? i thought it was demi ?
really ? i never heard of a semi tractor trailer .
you know i think she might have something there .
and then assuming the strike is resolved on april NUM we ah play the angels . so let 's clear a floor at the anaheim hotel .
ade you 're a wonder .
ade i have to tell you i i have never met anybody so efficient .
i mean you 're just you 're just a marvel of organization .
it 's like i 'm thinking of something and you 're one step ahead of me .
do you uh do you know what i 'm thinking about now ?
is it uh doable ?
ade you are incredible
what ? oh my god .
ade ahh ahh ah i 'm giving you a raise .
yeah .
not that i 'm aware of no .
i did n't think ahead .
i did n't say any other bawdy things .
all right you know you 're not any help at all here . i do n't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore .
yeah well i guess the only thing i can do is go into george steinbrenner 's office and tell him he has to give her a raise .
NUM days .
what ?
mr . steinbrenner can i talk to you for a second ?
well you know to be honest sir my my new secretary ade came up with that one .
she supports her whole family .
yes in fact her mother is in the hospital right now . it 's some kind of a diverticulitis .
she ca n't even afford to go out to lunch . she 's been eating in a high school cafeterias she pretends to be a teacher . it 's pathetic .
you know what i was just thinking she could really use a raise .
yes well i sat down with mr . steinbrenner . i told him you have been doing great work . i said that you deserved a raise and if you did n't get it that i was leaving .
oh well do n't worry about it he 's got plenty of money .
so you got a $NUM NUM a year raise .
you 're making more than i am .
what are you doing ? you 're making more than i am . a secretary cannot make more than her boss .
but mr . steinbrenner how can i be expected to perform my job properly knowing that my uh subordinate is making more money than i am ? with all due respect sir it 's outta whack .
yeah . what are you doing with the daily worker ?
your boyfriend reads the daily worker ? what is he ? a communist ?
maybe he 's just very well red ?
well does he wear bland drab olive colored clothing ?
huh he 's a communist . . . . look at this . exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important . . . . appearance not important . this is unbelievable . finally this is an ideology i can embrace .
hey .

duncan meyers ?
i looked up . i could n't believe it .
so you lied to her ?
hey did i tell you i called one of those girls from the personal ads in the daily worker ?
and they say appearance is not important .

but i digress . let me see now . you were standing at one end of the line and i was right next to you . and i remember we were even for like the first five yards and then boom you were gone .
head start oh no absolutely not .

kramer she 's a model .
i have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating .

yes full . i love to be full love to sit back loosen the old belt and digest away for hours . let those enzymes do their work .
where you going ?
you 're fresh you 're very fresh . you seem very fresh to me . you 're very vital . i could n't take you any fresher .
well i heard a noise .
you know blah
from the bathroom .
every time we go out to eat the minute we we 're done eating she 's runnin to the bathroom .
elaine of course i 'm concerned . i 'm paying for those meals . it 's like throwing money down the toilet .
let me digest it . let me get my money 's worth . y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me .
hey maybe i could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room .

the switch ?
ca n't be done .
do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the roommate switch ? in the middle ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it .
well i 'm sure at some point between the years NUM and NUM somewhere there were two women living together .
all right dammit i 'm in .

all right . let 's go over it again one more time .
that 's right .
keep going .
continue .
a few days go by and a call is placed at a time when sandy is known to be busy at work . once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor which she of course cannot resist an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered .
you disappoint me my friend . sandy wants nothing to do with you . she tells laura if you want to waste your time with that pervert that 's your problem . '
this is what i do .
so glad .
and why should n't you ? be fresh stay fresh
uh yeah . do you know babs ?
babs left ?
ah ha .
i was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert .

hey what happened with sandy . i forgot all about it . did you call her ?
so what happened ? she throw you out ? eh ?
so what happened ?

that 's unbelievable .
do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia ?
you 're not goin to do it ? what do you mean you 're not goin to do it ?
are you crazy ? this is like discovering plutonium by accident .
if only something like that could happen to me .
i know .
hey cosmo what happened to your mother last night . she hung me out to dry .
it would have been nice if someone told me about it . i just think you could have said something . that 's all .

heh heh .
so scott 's your roommate huh ?
no you did n't mention it .
i 'm sure i will .
yes . a male roommate .
it 's a huge problem jerry . the hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place . he 's already got that .
no . believe me he 's not .
she 's confiding in him about our dates . you always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date . it 's just a matter of time till they realize hey we could have sex . '
exactly . you know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity ? they just put them in the same cage .
oh that 's the worst part of it . he looks just like me .
i look like me and i 'm working from the outside . who do you think is in the better position ?
ho ho . this bizarre ? harrod ? experiment must end .
i got to find a way to work this out i love that apartment . it 's so cozy i 'm ensconced in velvet . you know if it were socially acceptable
i 've said that before ?
hey .

what a movie . good choice .
oh scott scott . he 's really great is n't he ?
yes he is . let me ask you something . when you come out of the shower and you put your robe on do you cinch it real tight are you concerned about that ?
do you hold the neck together with one hand or are you just letting it flap in the breeze ?
what 's the massage situation ?
is there any work being done ? is there any rubbing touching finger manipulation on the other person and if so who 's making the request ?
say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning what 's the outfit ? i mean you dressing up or is it come as you are ?
