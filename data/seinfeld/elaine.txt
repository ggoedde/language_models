huh thursday is no good because we 've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors .
i know i know . i 'm sorry i 'm late .
i dropped a grape .
i dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared . i could n't find it . i was i was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape . i have no idea where it went .
no i 'm just getting over an allergy attack . this guy i 'm going out with
robert . yes . thank you . he has two cats and i 'm allergic to them . you know i finally meet a normal man and i ca n't even go into his apartment you know . and of course my apartment is the actor 's studio so we ca n't go there . it 's really causing a lot of problems you know . he wo n't even go away for the weekend because of these cats .
vanessa .
hey why do n't you take her to that place in vermont i was telling you about ? you know that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold . she 'll love it .
you 're getting what ?
i 'd do it but i do n't have any money .
televising opera ?
tuna ?
they 're dying in the nets .
jerry ca n't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine ?
and i 'm going to have an english muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee .
thank you . what evidence is there that cats are so smart anyway ? huh ? what do they do ? because they 're clean ? i am sorry . my uncle pete showers four times a day and he ca n't count to ten so do n't give me hygiene .
i do n't know . i ca n't think of any solution unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident . what do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats ?
what do you think jerry ? you want to make twenty eight bucks ?
how about we go over there right now and we shave them ?
he actually went to the hospital ?
oh man he 's nuts .
did n't work huh ?
we well what are you going to do about the stock ?
i 'm kinda full .
oh god .
no i just have a cold .
i gave him an ultimatum .
they 're very clean animals .
almost as bad as losing out to a perfume .
superman can go back in time ?
hi .
hey what are you doing ?
oh no . no . i do n't want to sit in the back . i 'll be left out of the conversation .
yes i will george . i 'll have to stick my chin on top of the seat .
why ca n't you sit in the middle ?
you 're afraid to sit next to a man . you 're a little homophobic are n't ya ?
hello jerry .
did you get a haircut ?
tell me if you think this is strange . there 's this guy who lives in my building who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend . he 's a uh teacher or something . anyway after we met whenever we 'd run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little . nothing much . little pleasantries . he 's a nice guy he 's got a family . then after a while i noticed there was not more stopping . just saying hello and continuing on our way . and then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition . so fine . i figure that 's where this relationship is finally going to settle polite nodding . then one day he does n't nod . like i do n't exist ? . he went from nods to nothing .
and now there 's this intense animosity whenever we pass . i mean it 's like we really hate each other . it 's based on nothing .
really ?
you would do that ?
hi .
you know you have the slowest elevator in the entire city . that 's hard to get used to when you 're in so many other fast ones .
unless you 're married to a dictator .
right . exactly . so i imagine at some point somebody 's going to offer me some cantaloupe ?
so i had what you might call a little encounter this morning .
yes .
yes . i spotted him getting his mail . and at first i was just going to walk on by but then i thought no no no . no . do not be afraid of this man . '
so i walked up behind him and i tapped him on the shoulder . and i said hi remember me ? and he furrows his brow as if he 's really trying to figure it out . so i said to him i said you little phony . you know exactly who i am . '
i did . i most certainly did . and he said he goes oh yeah . you 're jeanette 's friend . we did meet once . and i said well how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by ? '
and he says he says look i just did n't want to say hello anymore all right ? and i said fine . fine . i did n't want to say hello anymore either but just i wanted you to know that i 'm aware of it . '
this cantaloupe stinks .
no no . i 'm fine .
jerry jerry . did you taste these peas ? these peas are great .
mmm phenomenal peas .
oh uh i do n't really eat dessert . i 'm dieting .
what about ponies ? what kind of abnormal animal is that ? and those kids who had their own ponies
i actually like ponies . i was just trying to make conversation . what time 's your game ?
and what time 's the funeral ?
how long does a funeral take ?
so you ca n't do both ?
how can you even consider not going ?
you know funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how i 'm actually going to die someday . me dead . imagine that .
is this a waste of time ? what should we be doing ? ca n't you have coffee with people ?
he has to go . he may have killed her .
oh yeah but i did n't say i hated anyone who had one .
maybe she 's there in spirit . how about that ?
george i met this woman . she is not traveling to any other dimensions .
phoenix ? what 's happening with his appartment ?
three hundred a month ? oh my god .
oh me too .
so i understand you 're moving to phoenix ?
mmm gorgeous exquisite town . so what 's happening with your apartment ?
oh you can have mine . i 'll ship it out to you . but what about that big apartment on west end avenue ?
dry wet what 's happening with your apartment ?
i have an idea . leave the winter clothing in the apartment and i 'll watch it for you and i 'll live there and i 'll make sure that nothing happens to it .
oh jeffrey .
i remember saying to myself why is jerry so far off the base ? '
i could n't believe it when i saw you running . i thought maybe they had changed the rules or something .
makes you wonder though does n't it ?
you know the spirit world .
i never saw anyone play like that .
yeah but that does n't make up for killing her .
the back ? they never find anything in the back . if they had anything good in the back they 'd put it out in the front .
yeah .
i 'm not so sure he wants one .
hey do n't forget sunday okay ? you and george are coming right ? hotel westbury eight o'clock .
what ? what you do n't want to go now ?
no jerry you have to . i need a buffer . you know i have n't seen my father in a while and you know
so that 's why we 're not together anymore .
try it on .
wow this is soft suede .
oh my god .
you have no idea .
no idea .
there is no park and the team has relocated .
oh man that is a beautiful jacket though .
well it 's just a lining . you can always have it changed .
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry . where is dad ?
kramer . that kramer . i 'm just about to leave he calls me up . he begs me to sit in his car for two minutes so he can pick up these birds
well he said he 'd drive me here right after . so i am sitting in his car twenty minutes . he does n't come down . i am freezing . then a cop comes by tells me to get out of the car . he 's a city marshal . he 's towing the car away . kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets . he was going to tow it with me in the car . so they tow the car . now i am standing outside and i am freezing but i cannot leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car . so finally he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves . he said he was getting special instructions that each dove has a different diet so we 're wandering around trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out . now we 're running down the street after these doves i almost got hit by a bus . so how 's everything going over here ?
good . cause dad can make some people a little uncomfortable .
man kramer . i could kill him .
oh hi dad .
no one .
fine .
yeah i 'm reading manuscripts for pendant publishing . i told you ten times .
ohh it 's snowing . it 's beautiful .
yeah .
okay . hello . listen thanks again for coming last night . dad said he had a great time .
no he 's driving back to maryland tonight .
i did n't want to tell you this but usually he hates everyone .
yeah he like you though . said you reminded him of somebody he knew in korea .
dad thinks george is gay .
no he pretty much thinks everyone is gay .
is n't that ? oh is this from the snow last night ? ugh you know what you shouldo ve done ? you shouldo ve turned it inside out .
i once broke up with a guy because he did n't keep his bathroom clean enough .
oh yeah i told him all the time . you would not have believed his tub . germs were building a town in there they were constructing offices . houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
hi .
maybe coffee was coffee .
well some people drink coffee that late .
it 's all in your head . all she knows is she had a good time . i think you should call her .
oh why ? i love it when guys call me the next day .
all she 'll think is that you like her .
well she wants you to like her .
i do n't know what your parents did to you .
it is funny .
oh see this is the problem .
do n't forget .
y'know my brother in law once left a message on this guy 's machine and he blurted out some business information he was n't supposed to and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars so he waited outside the guy 's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape .
yeah .
i know . i need a lesson .
oh . my ballet tickets .
hey have you ever been to the ballet ?
you know i 'm going as a beard .
yeah . this friend of a friend knows this banker guy he 's i do n't know NUM years unbelievably gorgeous of course he 's gay .
so anyway his boss has a box at the met and he invited us to see swan lake which is fine but he 's afraid that his boss ca n't handle his orientation so i 'm going along as his date .
swan lake at the met .
hey is george still wearing that toupee ?
does n't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing ?
oh come on .
you look ridiculous in that thing .
well i think they might have sutured that thing to your brain .
well by now you think people would be a little more open minded .
yes indeed .
really . why ?
well believe me this did n't happen overnight . robert 's not exactly a one woman man if you know what i mean . no sirree bob . sure i mean in a lot of ways he 's a typical guy he likes his sports but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet or the pleasure he gets in watching ms . liza minelli belt out a few choice numbers . it 's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is .
oh hi honey .
oh it was such a great night .
no i was a fantastic beard . i held hands i called him honey .
oh it was such a great night . oh .
oh i did ?
oh .
he 's incredible .
yeah i know .
what ?
well it did occur to me .
why ? is it irrevocable ?
we 've got a good team .
why ca n't he play for us ?
we just got along so great .
no no no i sensed something . i did sense something . i perceived a possibility jerry .
i realize that .
yes i am .
melrose place ?
i just did n't know you watched that .
i mean every time i mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation .
you mean this whole time we could have been discussing sydney and michael and jane
why ? why were you so embarrassed ?
that is so stupid . why do n't you just confess ?
so what are you going to do ?
oh who do you think you are ? castanza ?
oh god this tastes terrible .
no .
no . i 'm sick of shaking . you 've got to shake everything .
so i 'm going out tonight with robert and the boss and his wife .
yeah i think i might .
what do you mean bald ?
oh come on .
well maybe she got a haircut or something .
yeah i 've heard of that . i mean they usually wear a wig .
do you see the irony here ? you 're rejecting somebody because they 're bald .
you 're bald .
i do n't like this thing . and here 's what i 'm doing with it .
well i figured that 's what couples do .
well it was easy . really .
oh uh wait a second . would you like to come upstairs ?
yeah . upstairs ?
i was hoping you know that you might be interested in changing teams ?
have you ever thought about it ?
robert we need a shortstop . real bad .
hey i did it .
i turned him . he defected .
because i 'm a woman . ba ba ba boom chicka boom chicka boom boom boom .
well it 's a lesson for the kids out there . anything 's possible . jeromy i have hit the jackpot . the perfect man . nothing but sex and shopping .
he went back .
well here 's the thing . being a woman i only really have access to the uh equipment what thirty forty five minutes a week . and that 's on a good week . how can i be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment and have access to it twenty four hours a day their entire lives .
yeah i guess i never really stood a chance .
yeah . thanks . is melrose place on ?
okay .
hey george i am really proud of you . i really do admire what you 've done .
what is the matter ?
i did n't ruin anything . he looked like an idiot . he did and it made him act like a jerk .
hey .
wendy george . wendy .
george .
bye wendy . i 'm sorry .
what did you do that for ?
ask about your arm .
she 's a physical therapist . she does n't want to have to deal with that outside of the office .
because it is what she does .
george you got a little something right here .
why ?
huh yeah i know . it 's not very flattering .
oh i could never say anything to her about that .
yeah . hah .
no . if you tell him to do it he 'll never do it .
hoh . yes yes you 're right . that 's right . i 'll bring her over to meet
kramer .
yeah . this is going to work out just fine .
wha w are you going home ?
uh could you come back in about five minutes ?
no reason . just want to see you again .
yeah she 'll be here any second .
listen jerry . she never dates and i know it 's because of her hair .
well this is it . shall i go get kramer ?
what is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody 's face ?
how bout an intercourse hello ? how would that be ?
that 's her . that 's her .
oh you hear that ? that must be kramer .
uh kramer . kramer i 'd like you to meet my friend wendy .
oh you were ?
kramer if she wants to change her hair
oh kramer .
you want to go out with him ?
well it 's just that uh i do n't
i 'm just thinking about the question .
hey kramer my friend wendy wants to go out with you .
hee hee hee . hee hee hee
nothing nothing .
why ?
oh yeah there 's nothing better than skiing .
ugh the hell with em .
what 're you stopping here for ?
oh no i 'm three more blocks .
yeah but it 's only three blocks .
alright well
she 'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and all of a sudden three blocks from my door she decides this trip is over . is n't that strange ?
i 've never heard of anything like this . i mean it 's almost as if i was hitch hiking and she says well this is as far as i can take you . '
i had to carry my skis and my boots and my poles . i think i pinched a nerve in my shoulder .
yeah alright i got to go .
george .
wendy i injured my shoulder wednesday when you dropped me off and i had to carry my skis and my boots and my poles and everything all the way home . i 'm i 'm having trouble lifting my arm . do you think you could give me some treatment ?
insurance ? you 're charging me ?
oh huh huh that is a good idea . c 'mon george .
and you know you might want to do something about that hair .
huh i think it 's a little old fashioned . do n't you ? uh tell her .
where 've you been ? we 're going to miss the movie let 's go .
what guy ?
six . but then the night doorman comes on . he 's much scarier . whugh . ha ha .
i

give that to me .
hello mr . pitt . how 's scotland ?

ugh . so now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman ?
what is wrong with george ?
i ca n't believe you left your post .
hey what 's up ? what 's going on here ?
jerry let 's get out of here .
what were you doing watching the door anyway ?
you know my fingerprints are all over this . that doorman knows you 're a friend of mine . he 'll tell that co op lady she 'll tell mr . pitt jerry i 'm in this too deep .
alright shut up . shut up . just let me think . i got to think . we got to get our story straight .

yeah . that 's what i just said .
yeah i know what you were just . it 's not helping .
okay you came to pick me up at

so what ? no one 's going to believe a doorman .
just stick with the story . we 'll be fine . let me do the talking .
good . now fix me a drink .
oh really ? the doorman . and pray tell what did the doorman say ?
oh my . well the doorman certainly has a wild imagination does n't he ?
he never watched a door before mrs payton he did n't know how to do it . you know he 's a comedian mrs payton they do n't know how to do anything .
do n't you see what 's going on here ? he set us up . he 's playing all these mindgames .
there was nothing i could do . he said he had a federal express slip with your signature on it .
is it possible we were victims of a sting ?

i was with david putty last night .
he did the move .
you know the move .

jerry . there is no confusing that move with any other move .

well wait wait a second .
is n't that a little rash ?
yeah but i like the move .
well he does n't even do it exactly the same . he he he uses a pinch at the end instead of the swirl .
you know it 's strange because he 's such an honest mechanic .
oh god . oh god dave . oh yes . yes .

oh oh come on please ?
oh so so that 's it ?

well i hear three distinct sounds . a low rumple followed by a metallic squink
followed by a mysterious glonk . '

ga ga ? when did that happen ?
well maybe we should double . i 'm pretty ga ga myself .
yeah but we have a common goal .
yeah .
yeah of course .
oh please . he would n't say that .

although i have a hunch you mean it .
i know i do n't want kids .
well kevin maybe i have a little doubt . i mean nothing is a hundred percent .
what ?
really ?
you know that 's weird actually cause i 'm sort of the same way . i mean once for like no reason i flattened my hair and i had all these strands hanging in my face all the time
sometimes i think about wearing my hair real short .
yeah .
what are you guys doing here ?
why ?
what ?
i cut it .
kevin 's having his vasectomy reversed .
look . kevin . i really like you heh heh uh . but um maybe we 'd be better off just being friends .
well . i mean . oh god . this tuna tastes like an old sponge .

i put her stats on the back .

i am not buying a computer from you .
even so .
do n't get me wrong mr . lippman . i i 'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to lunge at me . huh . but the only reason you like me is because i 'm a shiksa .

thank you . ow .
i just wanted to know what your idea of hot is .
i am ready to skate up a ha ha ha why are you wearing that ?
a fur ?
a seemingly infinite supply .
ow . careful it 's hot .
he was strutting around the coffee shop like stein erickson .
eh anti fur . i mean who has the energy anymore ? this is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot .
we never dated in winter .
oh i walked by bloomingdale 's the other day and i saw that massage chair we want to get joe mayo as an apartment gift .
i ca n't stand joe mayo 's parties . you know the second you walk in he 's got you working for him . hey can you do me a favor ? can you keep an eye on the ice make sure we have enough ? uh

hey joe mayo .
oh fantastic .
goodbye dr . zaius .
good working with you .
what ?
oh . uhhh
so joe mayo had the same coat .
mm hmm .
so now joe mayo wants me to buy him a new coat .
no because i was in charge of the coats . it 's insane .
but he does n't know that . as far as he knows somebody stole it and that 's the person who should be responsible .
so i guess i 'll have to buy him a new coat even though i do n't think i should be held responsible which i am anyway .
look at you . you 're on a slant .
so you had to carry some of keri 's stuff . big deal .
you know what ? we sell this thing at peterman that would be perfect for you .
no . no . it 's a small men 's carryall .
it 's not a purse . it 's european .
hey did george buy joe mayo that chair yet ?
if i 'm getting him a new fur i 'm not chipping in on a gift too .
did he get it ?
mmm good . tell him i 'm out .
well i guess i better go and price fur coats .
what are you talking about ?
NUM street ? that 's where joe mayo lives . that 's the coat .
come in come in .
please sit down . newman um i wanted to talk to you about something .
what ?
uh yeah uh no . newman uh i heard that you found a fur coat in a tree . and i believe that it belongs to a friend of mine and i 'd like to give it back to him .
you know newmie . um i know how you feel about me and i have to tell you i 'm quite flattered .
oh yeah . i mean of all the men that i know you 're the only one who 's held down a steady job for several years .

all right we 're done here .
thank you thank you thank you very much .
jerry where 'd you get it ? that 's his coat .

it 's joe mayo 's coat .
yeah he was waiting inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies .
what is that ?
you ditched the fur ?
you 're going to wear this all the time ?
you know maybe kramer is right some people should just give up . i have .
i do n't remember but it certainly was n't this . look at this cartoon in the new yorker i do n't get this .
and you 're on the fringe of the humor business .
hey . george look at this .
you got it ?
come on we 're two intelligent people here . we can figure this out . now we got a dog and a cat in an office .
the cat is saying i 've enjoyed reading your e mail .
it 's a page number .
aahh . this has got to be a mistake .
we know what a face consists of .
hi .
jerry she looks exactly like you .
well maybe she does n't i do n't care .
well i 've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon . i mean i do n't understand why no one can explain it but i 'm going to get to the bottom of this .
hey . george janet looks very nice and she 's quite a handsome woman .
enjoy .
well we 're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier people wo n't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha for example i i really do well i love this one
ahan ahan yeah euh but why is it that the that the animals enjoy reading the email ?
well you do n't have to dissect if you can just tell me . why this is suppose to be funny ?
but what is the comment .
no it is n't .
i don t think so .
that 's not a word you have no idea what this means do you ?
then why did you print it .
you know what ? you people should be ashamed of yourself you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market . you think you 're doing comedy .
oh . really well you know i have others
she does a full hour about how you 're the devil . i got to go see this thing .
well i bet i can get in once i mention i 'm from the new yorker .
yes the new yorker i 've met with their cartoon editor and i got him to admit that that cartoon made no sense
then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about james thurber .
and he said i could submit some of my own cartoons .
i do to .
it 's better than your drawings of naked lois lane .
well boys i did it . i had to stay up all night but i finally came up with a great new yorker cartoon .
that is not the point .
just read it .
pretty good ? well uh . this is a gem . kramer look it what ? it 's funny .
and he 's saying i wish i was taller ha ha . see ? that 's his complaint .
do you . because that 's not a normal complaint .
everything with you has to be so jokey .
i wish i was taller that 's that 's that 's nice . that 's real .
i 'll tell you who does n't think it stinks the new yorker . that 's right . they 're publishing it in their next issue . oh . you know what i just ran into newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope sally weaver .
the pig says my wife is a slut . '
check it out from the new issue of the new yorker huh . funny is n't it ? look at it the pig wants to be taller and what 's this guy going to say ? he he nothing he he .
can i fix that after lunch sir ?
you see ? you see ? smart people think this is funny and you want to know why ? cause i wrote it .
oh . do tell sir ?
a ziggy ?
it must 've seeped up my subconscious puddy has ziggy bed sheets do you read the comics today ?

i offered them NUM they had no idea
how do people fast ? did ghandi get this crazy ? i 'm going to walk around see what dishes look good .
i hate this place . i do n't know why we came here i 'm never coming back here again .
remember when you first went out to eat with your parents ? remember it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before and they put it in front of you and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure ? and now i just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough .
jerry talk to that guy again .

because if there 's even the slightest chance of any problem at all i do n't want to take it because if i do n't get this guy on a plane to seattle and out of my life i 'm going to kill him and everyone who tries to stop me .
i heard a little ping in the car last time . what was that ping ?
jerry you cannot imagine how much i hate this guy and he has n't even done anything . it 's the situation . he 's a wonderful guy but i hate his guts .
i 've got it all mapped out i 'm taking the tunnel .
i spoke to a cab driver . for five bucks he turned me on to the rockaway boulevard shortcut .

no time for folding i think that 's it .
shoes ? shoes ? . shoes ? . shoes were n't invented till the fourth century . people walked around for thousands of years without them . i got this . let 's go .
i never new i could drive like that . i was going faster than i 've ever gone before and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion . i was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a gold metal run . i knew i was challenging the very laws of physics . at queens boulevard i took the shoulder . at jewel avenue i used the median . i had it . i was there and then i hit the van wyck . they say no one 's ever beaten the van wyck but gentlemen i tell you this i came as close as anyone ever has . and if it had n't been for that five car pile up on rockaway boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs .
yeah ?
he 's coming up . he 's coming up
oh that was awful . poor antonio . thanks .

jerry look at my fish .
my fish are dying right in front of me . we have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car .

excuse me i ca n't seem to find my car do you think you could drive me
oh that 's funny ? is that funny ? well tell me if you think this is funny these fish are dying . they 're gasping for oxygen right now . they 'll be floating in an hour . is that funny too ?
excuse me
sorry to have disturbed you . terribly sorry . but the fish will be dead . you do know that . they ca n't live in plastic . that 's not me talking that 's science .
jerry .
maybe he went to one of the other levels . i 'll go look for him .
no no i 'll be back .
and now he 's gone . i 'm sure he 's looking for the car . five minutes that 's all . i just want to find him .
but why ? why ca n't you do it ?

you do n't always smell someone from a drink .
what about one drink ? would you smell it from one drink ?

oh god . oh jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home . you would n't believe it .
okay . now listen . we were at the toll booth at the henry hudson parkway okay ? . and there were these like this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us okay ? . and for some reason i do n't know they just started to taunt us . and so then we payed the toll and then we went through and then they started to follow us alright ? . so george tries to lose them and and but they were in this really like a souped up car you know ? . and so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and i was just screaming . and then george is such a great driver .
oh he is fantastic . and then they fired a gun right up in the air .
i think it was a gun . and then they followed us all the way into the city and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home .
yeah yeah i 'm alright . oh by the way the car hit a pothole and now it 's making a clanking noise .
exactly .
oh he 's out in front of the building . he 's arguing with some guy about a parking space .
look out the window you 'll see .
ow . it 's my cuticle .
hi .
you know that guy downstairs ?
are you going down ?
is anything wrong ?
be down in a minute .
yeah it 's all taken care of .
i did a number on him it was a thing of beauty you really had to have been there to appreciate it .
i told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city .
yeah by the time i got to the end of the story he was to relieved that we were alive he could n't care less about the car .
what can i say you know ? it 's a gift . i only wish i could teach it but you know it 's inborn .
what ?
oh so that 's why you were acting so funny .
we just did n't think of you .
kramer ? i 'm so sorry really .
you see they had to move the cars so the truck could get through right ? but these guys do n't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them .
yeah . i know i said to myself why us ? you remember ?
right .
oh like you 've ever been bobulated .
why do n't you just flip a coin already ?
you know maybe if you had n't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were you might have got the space .
what ?

hey . gail .

my botticelli shoes . you 've been talking about my botticelli shoes .
did you or did you not tell kramer that i got my shoes at botticelli 's ?
who else have you mentioned my shoes to huh ? i want to know why my footwear is your conversation .
look i do n't like people talking about my shoes behind my back okay ? my shoes are my business . the two of you should n't have been looking at some fifteen year oldo s cleavage anyway .
but she was fifteen .
what ? what do you mean gail ?
what do you mean gail ? you do n't think i can attract attention ? you do n't think i can put asses in the seats ?
what ?
she wants my shoes ? what kind of person is this ? alright . she is not getting em .
no these were the last pair of these that they had .
no but these were the only really cool ones like this . do n't you see how everybody likes em and how everybody talks about em ?
oh yeah because she caught you jer

seven and a half .
uh excuse me are you using that ketchup ?
here 's your ketchup back . you know i had the hardest time trying to get some out . i mean i just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it . do you have any trouble ?
do you have a ketchup secret ?
because if you do have a ketchup secret i would really really like to know what it is .
mmmm .
you know i happen to have the script right here with me and uh on page NUM for example suppose the elaine character comes in wearing a a low cut dress . and the butler is very distracted and ca n't work .
well i 'm sure it 's right up russell 's alley .
alright well maybe i 'll mention it to russell tomorrow night .
bouchardo s on NUMrd .

i got him a two line phone .
never even seen you ? got to kinda envy that

hey who do you think is the most unattractive world leader ?
all time .
i dunno . you ever get a good look at degaulle ?
i got news for you . golda meir could make em all run up a tree .
y'know just because you two are homosexuals so what ? i mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already .
hear what ?
yeah you know people ask me that about you too .
and you get along well with women .
i got to go return something
thank you .
so she kept insisting i take off my coat . i refused and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it .

i signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens .
yeah . god i ca n't tell you how i feel . i mean i feel so good . i really feel good . the strange thing is i mean i have n't even met the woman yet .
well they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and i dunno you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it 's supposed to make them feel good .
last time i had lunch with you here . you were going on and on and on about how you wanted to meet somebody who did n't speak english .

i do n't know what i 'm going to do . i ca n't look the woman in the face . i mean i keep thinking that that goiter 's going to start talking to me you 'd think they 'd mention that before they send you over there oh by the way this woman almost has a second head . but no no i did n't get any goiter information .
y'know you try to do some good . you want to be a good person but this is too much to ask .
hey georgie what happened with your guy ?
how do you get fired from a volunteer job ?
i wish i could quit
oh well that sounds like a lot of fun
uh huh

she gave it to charity .
i do .
oh that 's ok i do n't have much time though . so
that was two months ago .
russell you are the president of nbc . you can have any woman you want .
god i hate these mixtures . why do n't they just put pretzels on the table . even peanuts would be good but i do n't know how eats these cheesy things .
um look russell you 're a very sweet guy . but i got to be honest with you . i do n't like television and that 's your world . that 's your life . i mean maybe if you were in i do n't know greenpeace or something that would be different but network television i mean come on russell you 're part of the problem .
oh yeah oh yeah . i 've heard of him . he 's that did you ever notice this ? did you ever notice that ? guy .
really ? what is it about ?
what do you mean it 's about nothing ?
um i got up . um i went to work . then i came here .
russell see i 'm really not interested in this stuff and i do have to go to work . so
i 'm sorry russell . i 'm sorry ok ? bye bye . .
so who 's playing elaine ?
really ?
who is it ?
oh my god
listen was russell at the casting ?
you know i 'm a little bit worried about him . i do n't understand . we had one date two months ago . am i that charming and beautiful ?
why do i keep setting you up ?
could we get a little more ? aghh you know ever since this new owner took over the service here is really slow .
mmm . they 're putting a little lemon in the tuna . i love that .
yeah ?
ah
yes i would say .
do you think it 's a coincidence ?
hi . excuse me . who does all the hiring waitresses here ?
you know what ? that 's discriminatory . that is unfair . why should these women have all the advantages ? it 's not enough they get all the attention from men they have to get all the waitress jobs too ?
it 's me .
hey .
what 's the matter with him ?
oh
so i spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop .
so we decided i should go over there and apply for a job myself .
because it 's discriminatory
yeah .
exactly .
who was it ?
what about the dogs ?
no i 'd like to apply for a waitress job .
oh yeah . i 've been a professional waitress for the last NUM years . i 've worked all over the city . these uh are my references . i 'm sure you 'll find that i 'm more than qualified .
you 're in big trouble mister . and i mean trouble with a capital t .
anyway there 's at least four of them and they 're all huge . and one is bigger than the next . it 's like a russ meyer movie .
oh he 's this guy who made these terrible movies in the NUM 's with these kinds of women . he 's obsessed . he 's obsessed with breasts . that 's hard to say .
um well there 's not really much more to tell . he was looking for waitresses and i went in to apply for the job . and he looked me up and down and he rejected me .
hi .
well it 's all taken care of . i filed a report . an investigation is underway .
no . i do n't think i should go . i really do n't want to bump into russell . he called me the other day . he wo n't quit .
jerry this is not a crush . this is a complete fixation . he makes me very uncomfortable .
hey are you going to go ?
oh right .
see now this is exciting . this is exciting . did i miss anything already ?
nah now it 's on tv . it 's different . i told everybody i know to watch it .

i did n't know that he 'd fall for me and i 'd drive him insane . i mean you know that 's not my fault .
i ca n't believe this ? what happened to him ? where the hell is he ?
nothing has changed . how did this happen ? ah these are the two guys i talked to at the equal employment opportunity commission . hey . what are you two guys doing here ? i thought you were going to do something about this . now you 're eating here ?

well i was just curious why you did n't use an exclamation point ?
see right here you wrote myra had the baby' but you did n't use an exclamation point .
so it 's ya nothing . forget it forget it i just find it curious .
well i mean if one of your close friends had a baby and i left you a message about it i would use an exclamation point .
you do n't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point .
i just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby .
well you know jake you should learn to use them . like the way i 'm talking right now i would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences . on this one . and on that one .
why ?
well i felt a call for one .
i found it very troubling that he did n't use one .
oh he 's not on drugs .
all right here you call him right now . see if he 's sniffing right now .
so what ?
people go to south america .
so because of a few bad apples you 're going to impugn an entire continent ?

ohh what are you going to do ? you going to put on phony beards and dress up like arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room . i mean come on
you wanted to see me mr . lippman ?
yes yes i did .
uh well um i felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity .

oh forget it i hate those . everytime i take one the driver will not stop talking to me . no matter how disinterested i seem he just keeps yakking away . blah blah blah blah blah . why does everything always have to have a social componant ? now a stage coach that would have been a good situation for me . cause i 'm in the coach and the driver is way up there on the stage .
yea i guess that could work .
pardon me ?
yeah .
you know i i 'm having a lot of trouble um hearing you back here . so
i 'm going to have to be honest with you . i 'm going deaf .
what ?
it can be very frustrating .
am i fearing aids ? oh yeah sure who is n't . but you know you got to live your life .
tom hanks ? after me you 're picking up tom hanks ? i love him .
yeah . yes it does
no no no no .
hey .
what is this about ?
you are kidding . that is amazing . i just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me i pretended i was going deaf .
oh did n't work . he caught me hearing . alright it 's terrible but i 'm not a terrible person .
no . when i shoo squirrels away i always say get out of here . i never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people .
yeah and when i see freaks in the street i never ever stare at them . yet i 'm careful not to look away see because i want to make the freaks feel comfortable .
yeah and i do n't poof up my hair when i got to a movie so people behind me can see . i 've got to make it up to this guy or i wo n't be able to live with myself . what can i do ?
really ?
oh great thanks kramer .
yeah i think he 's right . i 've never seen a ball man .
hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw george at the tennis match on tv yesterday .
i heard you really inhaled that thing . did anyone tape it ?
oh come on . if she 's that superficial you do n't want her .

yeah so they say .
yeah . okay .
three days and he has n't called me and you know why ? because he thinks i 'm too fat .

no . what about him ?
un huh .
jerry come on look . let 's go over to that yogurt store .
now look what you 've done .
oh it stinks .
hey you guys listen to this . listen to this . apparently some blood spilled into mr . giuliani 's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be NUM points higher than was initially reported . ironically the mishap by bringing the non fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public probably clinched the election for the republican . it was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept giuliani into office .

like like this ?
what 's me ?
get out .
i 'm going down there .
let 's go .
it looks exactly like me .
what 's going on here ? how do you think this happened ?
you think that could be a coincidence george ? is that possible ?
excuse me . where did this come from ?
i 'm sorry . you ca n't tell me where the mannequin came from ?
well is there somebody around here i could talk to who would know ?
is n't it obvious ? this mannequin looks exactly like me .
did you just roll your eyes at him ? because let me tell you something if anobody should be rolling their eyes it is me at him about you .
what are you saying that i 'm not good enough for this hideous dress ? listen natasha i would n't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro trash rags . i 'll meet you outside .
so i found out who supplies the mannequins and i called em up .
i do n't know . they would n't tell me . jerry ? je hello ?
we certainly have .
no way .
no .
kramer forget it .
i thought george was meeting us here ?
he 's guarding a suit ?
so i made a little list of people who might 've made the mannequin . you know possible suspects .
there 's this blind guy at a party i was at and he felt my face for a really long time . you know to see what i looked like . he almost put his finger up my nose .
ok i 'm not going to tell you the rest of the list .
because you have an attitude .
oh .
yeah like a swoosh .
it must be the fabric . it 's rubbing between you thighs when you walk . that 's what 's making that swooshy sound .
hmm no you do n't .
the mannequin .
you think you can pose me however you want ? that 's my ass in your window .
no . you take that mannequin down right now or i 'm pressing charges . yes this is my attorney .
uh huh
uh huh . are you taking this down ?
jerry get the car .
just get the car .
where are you going ?
you guys are not going to believe this . i just got a letter from a friend of mine in chicago who was shopping and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me . what if there 're more . where are they coming from ?
you should have told that story about packyderm dropping the pizza .
do i know him ?
if you were a woman would you go out with him ?
ya i bet you would . alright give him my number .
why ?
is she ?
so ?
maybe he likes her .
so now you 're going to keep going out with her for spite ?
so then packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza and mind you know they are burning hot he can bearly hold em . i mean he 's like trying to juggle the pizza you know ah . and then they go flying out of
they go flying out of his hands and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face . and the whole place went crazy .
i know i know i was unbelievable
i know .
oh i 'm sorry jerry did n't suggest this sooner .
oh well good night .

eleven thirty ?
oh .
no .
i 'm just waiting for my friend george we worked out together .
yeah nice to see you too .
meh .
let 's make it fifty .
alright listen to this . remember that guy i was telling you about at the health club ?
yeah .
i waited he did n't show up . anyway this guy gave me an open lip kiss .
so ? we 've always just kindo ve pecked . this one had a totally different dynamic .
yeah . i mean his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip . but his lower lip landed well below my rim .
yeah . definite moisture .
yeah . listen i think he 's giving me a big signal maybe he wants to change our relationship . yeah ?
hey what happened to you ?
well what was it ? i mean i was waiting .
i mean maybe he wants to ask me out .
because he does n't pay any attention to me and uh he ignores me .
i respect that . mmm what happened ?
yeah ? what was it ?
you went in the shower ?
do you go in the shower ?
do you ?
did you ever hear of holding it in ?
how do you know ?
i can find out .
sure . ooh a project . that 's a definite signal .
oh thanks . that 's no signal who would n't like me in this leotard ? i look amazing in this leotard .
okay he open lips me he dreams about me we have an olive project that 's it i 'm asking this guy out . um you know greg i
oh yeah sure .
oh my god .
oh it was nothing for forget it .
yup you mean him ?
so what do you want me to do ?
how can i do that ?
yes but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when i offered him water .
are you kidding ? that 's very significant . if he was interested in me he 'd want my germs . he 'd just crave my germs .
george but if i ask him now i will have no chance of going out with him .
i i do n't know
no that 's not it .
why could n't you just wait ?
since when is a drain a toilet ? .
different pipes go to different places . you 're going to mix em up .
okay . okay . okay i will talk to him .
boy you do n't look good .
no you look pale .
hi greg .
ok . i got the machine next buddy .
never mind that look at the signal i just got .
lookit . he knew i was going to use the machine next he did n't wipe his sweat off . that 's a gesture of intimacy .
listen george . listen . he knew what he was doing this was a signal .
yeah . it 's a social thing .
no . i wo n't be a party to this .
okay i 'll talk to him . but you 're putting me in a very difficult position .
you 're really working up quite a sweat today huh ?
are you sure you want to do that ?
you 're interested in in her ?
ah . you know uh i 'm engaged . yep getting married in fifty years .
you know greg i would n't do that if i were you .
well correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it ?
yeah well at least he had a drain .
it 's us .
this is aaron .
oh that is soo nice aaron . is n't he nice ? so listen has jerry been showing you a good time ?

aaron
uh let me ask you a question . how come you asked mr . and mrs . seinfeld to go to the museum with you ?

i really do n't know mr . seinfeld
n i know they 're your parents jerry ang they 're very nice people . but do n't you think it 's odd that a thirty five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else 's parents are enjoying themselves ? i mean do n't you find that abnormal ?
i mean they 're your parents and you do n't do anything . so why is this stranger doing it ?
see see i ca n't even say anything you know because all he 's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice this is like certifiably nice .

eeaawww
so you guys are trying to work it out . that 's great .
oh he went insane ?
well . uh . i do n't know about sick . i mean maybe it was somebody who did n't want to talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit chat ang was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling did n't want to speak to them ah .

ah well .
it was totally out of the blue . we went upstairs to his apartment you know to look for the label maker .
no .
i said do you want to go upstairs ? '
what ?
why ?
you mean just because i asked him to go upstairs he thinks he 's going downtown ?
you 're crazy .
as soon as we walked in he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave . i did n't even get a chance to look for the label maker .
i 've got a confession to make .
i 've got super bowl fever .
so where are we staying ?
oh . big room ?
downtown ?
what do they have there a couple of beds ?
no but do n't you think there should be two beds ? there 's two of us .
hello tim .
do n't worry tim . i did n't come by to yell at you i did n't come by for that at all . i just came by to pick up my label maker . i gave you a label maker and now i would like to have it back .
but you gave me a ticket to the super bowl . hand it over whatley .
you do n't have the label maker do you ?
i knew it . you 're a regifter .
what ?
well i bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work . the way you worked on my filling you were so so gentle and so caring and so sensitive .
were you just talking about me ?
oh the guy with cancer ?
egh jake jarmel ?
why ? you do n't wear glasses .
well he 's having a two day book signing at waldens .
you know we had a really bad break up .
yeah the jujy fruits .
so he refused to tell you where he got the glasses ?
yeah is n't that just like him ? you know he has to be the only one who has em .
what ? you told jake i said hi ?
i ca n't believe you did that . why did you tell him i said hi ? i never said hi . when did i say hi ?
no no . kramer you do n't understand . he made the last contact between us . i had the upper hand in the post breakup relationship . if he thinks that i said hi then i lose the upper hand .
nowhere .
so what if i do ?
so you see kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me . when in fact it was an unauthorised hi .
that 's what i 'm saying .
correct .
correct .
correct . what 's that ?
how can you say that i still like you when i did n't even say hi to you ?
ah jake i uh
anyway i admit i was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him i did n't say hi but he did n't have to act so smug . oh i hate smugness . do n't you hate smugness ?
oh my god . that man over there . i think he 's wearing glasses that look just like jake 's . pull over stop the car . here here . i think i got a way of getting back at my ex boyfriend .
