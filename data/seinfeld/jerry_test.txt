you do of course try on when you buy ?
can you relax it 's a cup of coffee . claire is a professional waitress .
well there 's this uh woman might be coming in .
i told you about laura the girl i met in michigan ?
i thought i told you about it yes she teaches political science ? i met her the night i did the show in lansing
oh she 's really great . i mean she 's got like a real warmth about her and she 's really bright and really pretty and uh the conversation though i mean it was talking with her is like talking with you but you know obviously much better .
yeah .
yeah well not exactly . i mean she said you know she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we 'll get together .
what are you serious why why did she call ?
good . did you have fun ? you have no idea what you 're talking about now come on come with me . i got to go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway .
oh come on be a come with guy .
and you did n't even hear how she sounded .
laura .
yeah . yeah people do move . have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street ? yeah no problem .
meat ? i do n't i do n't know go hunt . well what happened in the game anyway ?
this is the signal ? thank you mr . signal . where were you yesterday ?
yeah .
let me just wipe the sink .
really ? how ?
right .
heeeey .
this is laura .
i ca n't believe you 're here .
you 're engaged ?
i swear i have absolutely no idea what women are thinking . i do n't get it okay ? i i i admit i i 'm not getting the signals . i am not getting it . women they 're so subtle their little everything they do is subtle . men are not subtle we are obvious . women know what men want men know what men want what do we want ? we want women that 's it . it 's the only thing we know for sure it really is . we want women . how do we get them ? oh we do n't know bout that we do n't know . the next step after that we have no idea . this is why you see men honking car horns yelling from construction sites . these are the best ideas we 've had so far . the car horn honk is that a beauty ? have you seen men doing this ? what is this ? the man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks . e eeehh eehhh eehhh . this man is out of ideas . how does it ? e e e eeeehhhh . i do n't think she likes me . the amazing thing is that we still get women do n't we ? men i mean men are with women . you see men with women . how are men getting women many people wonder . let me tell you a little bit about our organization . wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now . now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene . that 's why i think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like where to meet men ? we 're here we are everywhere . we 're honking our horns to serve you better .
what you must understand elaine packing is no different than leading men into battle . you 've got to know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon . from a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks .
yes .
i 'm not looking .
what ?

stolen ?
because i spent my money on the clapgo d NUM . it 's the most impenetrable lock on the market today . it has only one design flaw . the door must be closed .

the truth .
as a guy i do n't know how i can break up with another guy . you know what i mean ? i do n't know how to say bill i feel i need to see other men . do you know what i mean ? there 's nothing i can do . i have to wait for someone to die . i think that 's the only way out of this relationship . it could be a long time . see the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing . just two guys will just become friends just because they 're two guys . that 's almost all we need to have in common . cause sports sports and women is really all we talk about . if there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is so what 's in the refrigerator ? '
you know i read the lenny bruce biography i thought it was really interesting . he would
listen joel . there 's something i have to tell you
this friendship it 's not working .

i ca n't find the receipt .
what do you think this is a little scam i have ? i take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money ? in fact forget the money . i do n't even want the money . i just once i would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault . that 's what i want . i want an admission of guilt .
no . dry cleaned .
i do n't know fifteen hundred dollars .
oh yeah right .
well that 's good .
so i guess you do n't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold charming ?

i did . i 'm just curious . it 's been almost a week . i want to check it out . six points ? it 's up six points .
you did not tell me not to sell .
no what ? that 's probably why
a robot butcher ?
i 'm not an investor . people always tell me you should have your money working for you . i 've decided i 'll do the work . i 'm going to let the money relax . you know what i mean ? cause you send your money out there working for you a lot of times it gets fired . you go back there what happened ? i had my money . it was here it was working for me . yeah i remember your money . showing up late . taking time off . we had to let him go . '
no of course not .
you 're flesh and blood .
hi .
no shower . so where are we eating ?
no i just had a sandwich .
could you stop that smacking ?
what is this obsession people have with books ? they put them in their houses like they 're trophies . what do you need it for after you read it ?
so you want me to get the books ? is that it ?
ohh . you know and sometimes she 'll go hello jerry ? and i 'll go oh hi marlene . and then it 's jerry
you ca n't do that .
yeah .
good night .
i do n't care about it .
well he ca n't kill me right ?
well you know what they say . lucky in love unlucky with fruit .
really ? that guy who stopped saying hello ?
you 're kidding .
i thought you 'd be upset .
really ? i thought
of course i want to talk about it .
hi .
we won . i made an incredible play in the field . there was a tag up at third base and i threw the guy out from left field on a fly . we 'll be in the championship game wednesday because of me . it was the single greatest moment in my life .
we won . we 're in the finals on wednesday .
what is this about ?
what are you doing ?
you drew up plans for this ?
when do you intend to do this ?
i do n't see it happening .
oh yeah . where the people eat the plant life . the edible foliage tour .
mickey mantle ?
well actually we do have to kind of get going .
horses ? they 're like big riding dogs .
well i 'm sure you did . who would n't love a pony ? who would n't love a person that had a pony ?
really ? what a shock .
yes i know you 're not going to do it . that 's why i bet .
that 's the bet . that you 're not doing it .
well of course it could be done . anything could be done . but it only is done if it 's done . show me the levels . the bet is the levels .
that 's the bet . hello ? no oh hi no they just left oh my god hang on a second . maybe i can still catch em . ma . ma . up here . do n't get in the cab . manya died . manya died .
ah
i did n't even know the woman .
i mean i met her three times . i do n't even know her last name .
i do n't know what to do .
we do n't understand death . and the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow . and uh i mean hey you know . i think if you ca n't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point i do n't see how bedding accessories really make the difference . i mean they got the guy in a suit with a pillow . now is he going to a meeting or is he catching forty winks ? i mean let 's make up our mind where we think they 're going .
i know and then you say to yourself from this moment on i 'm not going to waste any more of it . but then you go how ? what can i do that 's not wasting it ? '
me ? what about you ? you brought up the pony .
fifty years they were married . now he 's moving to pheonix .
yeah .
i thought there were two outs .
but i went to the funeral .
what is the pony ? what is the point of the pony ? why do we have these animals these ponies ? what do we do with them ? besides the pony ride . why ponies ? what are we doing with them ? i mean police do n't use them for you know crowd control . hey uh you want to get back behind the barricades . hey . hey little boy . yeah i 'm talking to you . behind the barricades . so somebody i assume genetically engineered these ponies . do you think they could make them any size ? i mean could they make them like the size of a quarter if they wanted ? that would be fun for monopoly though would n't it ? just have a little pony and you put him on the baltic that 's two down go ahead . hold it . right there . baltic . yeah that 's it . fine . right there hold it right there . '
what is this ?
bad ? very bad ?
i 've got a ballpark .

okay take it .
what is that song ?
you know schumann went mad from that .
no you idiot .
he went crazy from one note . he could n't get it out of his head . i think it was an a . he kept repeating it over and over again . he had to be institutionalized .
i know exactly what 's going to happen tonight . i 'm going to try and act like i 'm not impressed he 's going to see right through it .
absolutely .
schumann . where are they ?
what you do n't want to do this ?
elaine 'll kill me .

you like that commercial ?
now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty ?
yeah they 're so funny and so comfortable with each other and i could be comfortable too if i had pants like that . i could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session .
no kidding . did you tell him that was the reason ?
you 're still thinking about this ?
she thinks you 're a guy that does n't like coffee .
what ?
did you call me a wuss ?
i got one problem . you 're keeping her busy in the other room . now what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in ? you have to signal me that she 's coming .

do n't you think she could tell ?
well i think you should either take it off or tell her about it .

now we have to buy a new couch ? .
the one with the poppie stain ? .
it 's hardly been used .

ohh . hey how you feeling ?
no poppie . no .
jimmy'
aw right . '
oh . how do you like that ? '
well where is it ? . '
they get all emotional they sway . it 's embarrassing . '
i do n't think so . '
yeah . what is that ? i mean is n't that sick . i mean i 'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment . '
he 's a doctor . . i mean it 's supposed to be like a sterile environment . '
so what about the penthouse . did you ask him ? '
what the hell 's going on over there ? '
hey . hey . watch it . . you 're drooling all over the floor . how much novocaine did that guy give you . '
wait a second where you wearing those shoes in the cab ? '
is this guy a dentist or caligula ? '
jimmy ?
ca n't believe your going out with him
did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person . jimmy can dunk . jimmy 's new in town . jimmy we 'll see you later . '
that 's jimmy . that 's the way he talks . '
no no you said george likes spicy chicken . '
where 's my mr . goodbar ? '
what ?
oooh . you . you ate these ? you sucked on these and put them on the plate ?
soo
it 's just
oh . man did you see that . i ate discarded food .
yeah . so
oh . . it 's an affectionate caricature .
oh . come on you told them you 're from out of town just so you could stay in a hotel room .
you know my parents are coming in and i got some clean up to do so if you and potsie are done scheming
i am not going to taste your peach . i ate some one 's pecan last night i 'm not going to eat your peach .
yeah . i think i got flea bites .
no .
what did you do about them ?
okay
i do n't know but every one 's got to clear out of the apartment for two days . i do n't know what i 'm going to do with my parents . they 'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own i 'm sure it 's going to be some awful dump . wait a second have you checked in the plaza yet ?
yes .
i dunno i 'm going to ask shelley but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident .
yeah . it 's all taken care of .
well you ca n't go in there it 's like a gas chamber in there .
aw . you 'll be fine you were in there for what a couple of minutes .
can you get me a soda ?
let me see those . oh . i know the chunky that left these chunkies newman . i 've got him .
there 's nothing pleasant about it so lets just cut the crap you gave me fleas . i know it and you know it
sure .
ahh . she threw me out .
yeah so .
what move ?
wait a second . my move ?
oh yeah . the pinch . i 've done the pinch . that 's not new . besides which i do n't know how you could trust any of his moves now . his whole repertoire could be lifted .
i know he 's probably the only honest mechanic in new york .
so he stole my move and he 's using it on elaine .
can i just get it opened first ?
it 's not even a question of that . the point is when something like this is passed along one must be certain that it 's going to be used in a conscientious way . this is not some parlor trick to be used
is it padded ?
good . how tall is she ?
now the ending is kind of an option . i use the swirl . i like the swirl . i 'm comfortable with the swirl . i feel the swirl is a great capper . he uses the pinch which i find a little presumptuous .
oh why fusilli ?
what move ? my move . the one i told you about . you used it on elaine .
the ending is the whole thing . without the ending it 's nothing . you had nothing .
swirl .
yeah ?
hello ? yeah this is jerry seinfeld . what ? twenty eight hundred dollars ? . that 's the estimate on my car ? . no do n't even do anything . i 'm going to think about it . okay bye .
hey elaine .
huh .
well look . here 's the work order with everything that broke . just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out .
hi .
sixteen hundred dollars ? that 's all ? ooh they are ripping me off .
what do you mean ?
if i was n't there i would n't have believed it .
he had to use cork screw pasta .
yep she 's not going to be back for a month but i got six hours .
so that 's it ? you know i never even met the guy .
you 're marching in .
hey . elaine 's quitting .
what for ?
i do n't care .
yeah you 're on top of it and i 'm on the bottom .
what is the complication ?
but someone is waiting for me .
which one do you think i want ?
yeah he was nice .
defent .
you need an exterminator ?
right i do n't want bridget to think i stood her up . i 'll never get another date with her . she 'll freak out .
what ? why did n't you wake me up ?
that 's it . no more questions . i do n't care .
hi alec .
yeah hey did i see you on tv at the ranger game ? were those your seats right behind the glass ?
yeah he 's dating a crayon .
toilet paper ?

well so it was n't a total loss .
hey i forgot to tell you . i got tickets to the rangers devils playoff game tonight .
what about you george ?
well what do i do with the extra ticket ?

i got to get a suit cleaned i have a funeral on friday .
yeah yeah that 's kinda what he gave me .
what ? after what you just went through i thought you said you 'd never say it again .
well not exactly .
look what do you want me to do ?
no .

she died .
you ca n't believe what i just did .
yes . right above me .
right above me .
she 's right in my building . right above me . every time i come in the building i 'm going to have to sneak around like a cat burglar .
if they were fanatic about showers they might .
yeah i 've heard that about wedding bands .
boys boys .
well that 's a lot of money . but if that 's the way it 's got to be that 's the way it 's got to be .
it was all over . taken care of . done . finished . five thousand . where 's she going to get five thousand ? she does n't have five thousand . clean . good bye . she 's gone . then you come in why do n't you loan her five thousand ? what do you care ? you 've got five thousand . give her five thousand . '
people do n't turn down money . it 's what separates us from the animals .
hi
oh yes . particularly if you 're not in it .
what 's to see ? a woman from norway a guy from kenya and twenty thousand losers .
i know .
it 's tremendous .
oh i would n't quite say that .
what are you talking about ?
elaine would never borrow that much money . kramer my god man . this is beautiful . i think i 'm in the clear here . elaine 's not moving in . i do n't have to confront her . she has no idea i never wanted her to move in . i 'm golden .
all the time . i 've been up there six times . they refuse to stop . i ca n't live like this . i do n't know what i 'm going to do . i 'm heading for breakdown . ca n't you do something ?

veggie sandwich and a grapefruit .

what about ?
they serve soup at NUM a . m . ?
how could you not ?
is it a lot of cream soups ?
why 'd you have to mention unlisted number ?
you went all night ?
you leave me no choice . you 're the media now as far as i 'm concerned .
i mean she 's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others i ca n't be with someone like that .
on the other hand
i thought you said it was imminent .
but you like this guy is n't that what the sponges are for ?
hi .
oh ok
oh
it completely turned her off .
it 's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind .
oh i told him he 'd never make it . he was up all night . oh my god kramer ?
to the right .
no elaine 's got this writer friend from finland rava . her boyfriend goes to columbia grad school and he 's suppose to do it .
and you are it .
no he 's it . he wins . it is good .
no no no come on kramer . now you got the socks .
all right c 'mon . let 's go .
all right
i got to get to the airport .
i do n't really feel that comfortable with a maid either because there 's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house . you know you 're sitting there on your sofa and they go by with the vacuum i 'm really sorry about this . i do n't know why i left that stuff over there . and that 's why i could never be a maid because i 'd have an attitude . i 'd find them wherever they are in the house oh i suppose you could n't do this ? no do n't get up let me clean up your filth . no you could n't dust . no this is too tough is n't it ? '
should n't you be out on a ledge somewhere ?
what 's the difference ? . that 's the one . he ripped me off . this guy ripped me off .
i ca n't believe it . this guy ripped me off .
ma i told you just dip the bread in the batter and put in right in the pan okay bye . my mother . she forgot how to make french toast . you know how mothers are .
no i do n't eat dinner . dinner 's for suckers .
nope the cop says it 's my word against his . there 's nothing they can do .
yeah yeah . do n't worry about it .
that 's comforting . shh . he 's coming . ray ?
well i did n't
yeah .
me .
well i
no i actually find you quite charming . a bit verbose at times
really ?
all right all right . what 's the big hubbub bub ?
maybe that 's why she 's happy .
what is this ?
lloyd .
mmm different . where 'd you get it ?
nah do n't bother .
i think i finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum . it 's a little lo mein y .
and in the end lloyd braun became more like you .
we 're all the way in the front row . why could n't we sit in the special seats ?
errh .
well lloydo s a very industrious fellow . i 'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to .
s not necessary .
i know that kramer .
i did n't see anything .
so you say she was on a horse ?
well if it is n't chesty la rue .
i was chewing gum with lloyd braun and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the alex .
why ?
yeah yeah .
i gave you a hundred dollars ? .
yes it is . it is surprising . does that bother you ?
all right . what are you outta your mind ? look at this . what did you buy here ? you will never be able to finish all this stuff .
hi .
john germaine ? that is amazing . i was just talking about him upstairs with elaine .
i should have helped kramer with those packages .
he stole back the rye ?
so do the ross 's know ?
well kramer 'll take them around for a while .
what the hell are you doing there ?
so you think clyde told him ?
no but i 've read articles and i must say it does n't sound very pleasant .
no . i 'm going to be just fine but as far as your situation you 're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it .
there 's none left ?
all right . all right . i 'll tell ya what i 'm going to do i will give you double what you paid for it .
i want that rye lady .
shut up you old bag .
how much did you give him ?
wait a second . i never baited a hook with a rye before . your hook is too small . this is for like a muffin . all right . take it away .
sounds familiar .
it 's wrong it 's rude and it 's incorrect .
we 're only kidding .
what are you going to get her ?
so you 're just taking off from work ?
what 's going on ?
you want to go with me up to the bronx and see if there 's any flyers on george 's car .
oh man look at this mess . you know what 's going to happen if they see this ?
yeah this quite a life i lead here huh ?
oh my god kramer is that woman just wearing a bra ?
no no not at all .
kramer i do n't think i can
nothing 's happened .
oh no no no wait a second wait a second th th that
yeah and we had an accident with your car it 's a it 's a little crumpled .
well you got to call your parents .
alright alright i saw her .
hey hey . wha wait what you 're going to leave it there ? that 's like half a pound of turkey .
yeah you 're right . i really should keep more of your favourites on hand .
what arrangement ?
yeah well lemme know when you get something in there and i will .
did you twist it ? you coulda twisted it .
awright .
seven ? yeah i guess i could see it . seven . seven periods of school seven beatings a day . roughly seven stitches a beating and eventually seven years to life . yeah you 're doing that child quite a service .
i got fifty right here in the cupboard . how about bisquik ? pimento . gherkin . sauce . maxwell house .
oh it 's no problem . you can take whatever you want .
alright .
hey is this your half a can of soda in the fridge ?
you cannot buy half a can of soda .
have n't seen him . how 's the neck ?
boy i 'm surprised . i would think kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person 's spine around .
course it would have to be someone who has n't heard the story before . someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment . someone whose heart is so dark it cannot be swayed by pity compassion or human emotion of any kind .
what in godo s name is going on here ? is she wearing the same thing over and over again ? or does she have a closet full of these like superman ? i 've got to unlock this mystery .
oh .
change ? yes i think that 's a super idea .
there must be a secret stash around here somewhere .
no no . c 'mon put something else on . it 's early let 's go out .
you know i 'm kinda tired myself . maybe i 'll just sleep here on the couch . then in the morning you 'll get dressed we 'll walk out together . both dressed different clothes . well i 'll be in the same clothes . you 'll of course be in different clothes because it 's your apartment . but we 'll go downstairs me in my same clothes you in your different clothes .
hello christie ? i was wondering if we could get together again ? oh really ? well you ca n't break up with me over the phone . c 'mon you got to do this in person . it does n't even have to be one on one you can bring a group of friends . i just want to see you . wait do n't hang up on me . why do you wear the same dress all the time ? hello .
i killed .
yeah . highest paying job i ever had .
nah nah . i 'd rather
and i 'm always impressed .
okay .
here check that out .
i told you .
i never shoulda told you .
no i ca n't feel anything .
actually i was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity .
no to tell you the truth i was thinking of buying my father a new car .
hey guess what . i just bought my father a cadillac
yeah ?
really ?
now there 's a match . you and katherine hepburn .
katherine hepburn ? oh yeah .
this is no good .
well if you ca n't tell susan about it then there 's something wrong .
hey cable guy 's looking for you .
well said he was waiting about two hours . seemed a little put out .
you do n't seem too bothered by it .
and best of all it 's a cadillac .
ahh i uh i do n't like to talk about it .
ah it 's just money .
what was that ?
uhm hold hold on a second . i 'm i 'm sorry i did n't hear what you said .
i 'm a good son .
c 'mon c 'mon .
i bought you a cadillac . here you go .
why ca n't i buy my father a car ?
that 's what i was thinking .
that 's right . i bought it .
he does n't want to take a ride .
you know you could put a fence around these condos and call it an insane asylum . nobody would know the difference .
last week on seinfeld .
hello ?
gee i dunno what to tell you .
uh i do n't think so .
bye .
yeah there 's some sickos out there .
well it was nice meeting you .
i do n't understand why we have to eat now .
ca n't we eat at a decent hour ? i 'll treat okay ?
hey look there 's a spot right in front .
awright let 's eat already .
yeah they 're in town this week you want to go ?
well they were humiliated . i mean after the impeachment my father left office in disgrace .
no social reason for them to be here .
yeah all right well i got some people here .
the only way out of this is if leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to florida .
i do n't know how you do it .
a man like you limiting yourself to one woman i do n't know . but it 's none of my business .
he has no idea who you are .
yeah .
well you used to sit in that hot tub ?
not from the footage i 've seen .
what 's going on ?
where are they moving to ?
all right fine . come over here .
you know what you 're doing do n't you ? you 're killing independent jerry . i got to go see my uncle leo . i think he may have made a big mistake .
well at least the costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move . they could n't bear being away from george .
hey . hey .
oh okay
oh it 's unbelievable . every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist .
yeah the other guy .
why ?
hey you look awful .
excited ? i 'm going to kill her . she knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box ? .
hey . a dinosaur .
wait where are you going ? do n't take your dolly and go home .
oh did you bring the bar b que sauce ?
how come ? i told you it 's fantastic .
oh oh wait this is n't the sauce that i asked for .
no no . i wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like charles grodin .
i do n't have any material .
that woman is such an idiot . i was going to do this whole bit on that bottle and now i got nothing to talk about .
show the doll show the picture of george 's mother it 's pretty funny . i 'm going to call them .

yeah well elaine .
that 's not the point . you put me in a position where i had no choice .
no i gave it back to you
forget it .
because you know we used to go out .
of course he did the guy 's working ya .

i ca n't go to sleep at nine o clock .
oh why do n't you go sleep over at newman 's .
well that 's all i got .
huh ?
kramer there 's no way you 're sleeping with me .
excuse me i 'd like to return this jacket .
well i want to return this jacket and she asked me why and i said for spite and now she wo n't take it back .
but i changed my mind
bye .
hello
wait a sec . i do n't want to do
i do n't want to mix in everything . my guys do n't know your guys . you ca n't just lock em all in the same machine together . they 'll start a riot .
this stuff on top is my friends . could i get it done in a separate machine ?
get outta here .
so what are you going to do now ? are you going to look for something else in real estate ?
so what are you going to do ?
uh huh . uh huh . in what capacity ?
yeah . yeah . you make good comments .
well they tend to give those jobs to ex ballplayers and people that are you know in broadcasting .
yeah . yeah .
well that 's where it gets tricky .
i would n't think so .
well it does n't sound like you completely thought this through .
yeah . pretend like it never happened .
sure . you 're an emotional person . people do n't take you seriously .
never happened .
that 's not that ?
you do n't want to tell me ?
what ? in his drink ? are you outta your mind ? what are you peter lorre ?
elaine ? how did you rope her into this ?
did he call you last night ?
what did you say ?
to the laundromat .
so anybody leaves anything here you can just take it ? you have a license to steal ? you are like the james bond of laundry ?
and what 's going to happen ?
no . nothing .
what 's with you ?
so know every time you get dressed . you are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer .
why do n't you see what you can do ?
yeah . why ?
sure . if there cheap why not .
so george . remember when i told you nikki gets whatever she wants . we are at the movies last night . it 's sold out . nikki goes and talks to the manager . right in .
she 's like a beautiful godzilla .
why ca n't you do this on your table ?
come on . dustin hoffman in star wars . he made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner

that 's another loop hole . that 's two dates without asking you out .
crazy like a man .
okay dokey

i got to pay this todd gack guy $NUM bucks just so he has some excuse to see elaine again without asking her out .
so what is steinbrenner going to do if he does n't get his calzones ?
no . i never had a job .
i did .
i know i know . but some how she explained it to me and i could n't say no .
actually it 's being taken care of right now .
you know what you do ? ask him a follow up question . tell him you 're having trouble getting started and you want his advice .
can i have my keys
you two keep an eye on each other ?
think she wants those clubs .
well that 's your ceiling .
do you hear this clunking ?
oh god .
now i got to take the car down to tony and get it checked out .
yeah he 's real good . but he 's so obsessive about the car . he makes me feel guilty about every little thing that 's wrong with it . i got to get it washed before i bring it down to him or i 'm afraid he 'll yell at me .
no i had n't noticed .
have i been picking at it ? no . you know . it 's just wear and tear .
the engine is really the only thing that needs checking .
you sure he did n't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown ?
how much money is this going to cost me ?
alright you know what uhm i just want to take my car and i 'm going to bring it someplace else .
well just get it down .
okay . thank you very much .

all of a sudden it hit me i realized what the problem is i ca n't be with someone like me i hate myself . if anything i need to get the exact opposite of me it 's too much . it 's too much i ca n't take it i ca n't take it .
yeah . too bad .
hello . oh . hi george what . really . all right i 'll call elaine we 'll meet you down there .

what do you mean you 're in the same class ?
yeah . was that a beauty or what ?
no no no it 's she 's not really dead if we find a way to remember her . '
before we go any further i 'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise .
well it was the best of those movies .
huh ?
i got to do some research here .
oh i 'm the doofus ?
you know it occurs to me that kramer is at karate right now .
yeah that 's what i was thinking .
dad i would n't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo .
so did you stop by the dojo ?
how 's your confidence level ?
what happened to you ?
it 's the new cover of the j . peterman catalog . it is elaine 's choice . let 's congratulate her .
vaya con dios .
hey georgie . i 'm doing some research down at the coffee shop . your story 's the one .

i got to go meet pam .
she 's having carol gail and lisa over . you know they all have kids now ?
perpetuation of the species .
so elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day
you know if you really want to test him out why do n't you try the old jerry lewis trick ?
i thought you might .
hi sorry i 'm late .
why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much ?
play the tape maybe we 'll get a clue .
what do you make of it ?
is that right ?
what about her name ?
she 's got really nice hair .
you 've got really specific tastes .
maybe i could you 're making some pretty good points .
i think i can . i even like the name . pam .
a barren sterile existence that ends when you die ?
i just came by to tell you i 'm really really happy about this relationship . really happy .
i ca n't believe i 'm losing pam .

what look ?
well you 're the big look expert . i want to see how smart you are .
what ?
i mean let 's say we did .
why should n't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to ?
of course i guess maybe some little problems could arise .
when we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters . but sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over . when that is not really sleep . sleep is separate from that . and i do n't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that .
well now we 're getting somewhere .
fine . well .
you ready ?
so think you can handle this ?
hey .
all right okay . we 're in the apartment watching tv .
no separated .
she must 've taken some kind of seminar or something .

i think we 've worked out a system .
no this is very advanced . we 've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls .
spending the night . optional .

so the squirrel 's going to make it ?
you shut up .
even more reasonable .

he took out kruger ?
dermatology ?
oh what 's the point ?
revenge date ? that sound like you more than me .
you 're right . i 'm going to call her right now and tell her off .
well i 'm a classy guy . how 's the life saving business ?
it must take a really really big zit to kill a man .
he looks like a peanuts character .
what about your sea sickness ?
what are they for ?
eh it went okay .
yeah i started out real classy
must i ?
was it pimple popper md ?
what the hell is this ?
no .
nothing i got up run some errands i went down to sara 's office and apologized
she did kind of touch my face .
i do n't know this ?
come on sitarides cop to it . what brand of perverted science do you practice ?
am i ? you touched my face . i did n't imagine that .
so kramer pulled it off ?
hey this looks like the thing i have . caused by exposure to benzene a common ingredient in metal cleaners .
what are you doing ?
that 's my hand towel . i use that on my face hands and chest . that 's where the hives are coming from . it 's not from dr . sitarides it 's from dr . van nostrand .
i ca n't believe kruger did n't fire you after all you did .
yeah i finally got to see dr . kazarian . he said it was really bad .
i do n't want to talk about it .
till she found out elaine slept with the groom .
i ca n't believe we went all the way to india for a wedding .
i do n't know what that means .
hey .
alright i admit it . i slept with nina but that 's all .
i 'm really sorry .
where 'd you get that one ?
no what ?
bless you .
i think it 's the stench of death .
this is going to be great .
uh huh . hey look what they had on the plane . schnapps .
i 'm just hanging out in this hell hole because of george .
especially when you got a layover in sarajevo .
uh huh
sure .
nothing . and neither will you . george can never know about this it 'll crush him .
probably the reason
kramer i know what i 'm talking about . there 's no way fdr wants you to drop dead .
just go back and ask him again .
well everybody 's a little cranky on their birthday .
so you think it 's a non vite ?
he wants me to set him up with this girl nina stengal .
i was kidding when i said that .
are you ?
if we ever had a problem with elaine we could bring in nina and not lose a step .
anyway like i was saying i could n't make the transition from conversation to sex . there were no awkward pauses i need an awkward pause .
oh i 'm sure it 's fine .
really ?
ah .
back together ?
ah
no i think the head does most of the stretching .
that was an hour ago . what were you doing in there ?
so ?
mmm .
sure .
coughing naked it 's a turn off man .
but the thing you do n't realize is that there 's good naked and bad naked . naked hair brushing good naked crouching bad . hey there 's hanke .
oh come on .
no i told you it 's just a dry run .
uhh
world war i plane ?
i found a rough spot on the kitchen floor i thought i 'd polish it up with this belt sander i have here .
by the way my bad naked demo did n't quite work .
oh great . elaine . what is wrong with my body ?
so i 'm glad we had a talk and worked this out . do n't you feel this is better ?
insert a knife into the center and twist . then to make it bloom soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes .
oh sure . with out the parents it 's a breeze .
see ? you give and you get .
to a children 's charity .
hey .
atomic sub ? why are you eating there ?
when george was growing up
and instead of a tree did n't your father put up an aluminum pole ?
no you walk out .
why did n't you ever mention this ?
really ?
like the batman villain ?
a donation has been made in your name to the human fund . what is that ?
so uh what do you feel like eating ? chinese or italian ?
i ca n't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop . i mean what if things you know progress ?
that 's not a french cuff shirt you know .
uh why do n't we stay here ? the back booth just opened up . now this is a good looking booth .
oh i know who 's cooking today .
she did n't touch it .
gwen . how 'd you know i was here ?
i thought you were on strike ?
yeah they have been promising that for a while
what about harrison ford ? he had one in uh blade runner . that was a cool one .
thank you .
all right we 're going in .
george . sorry we 're just waiting for david puddy .
hey .
so puddy i decided i 'm going to go with another NUM convertible .
so puddy this is a pretty good move for you huh ? no more grease monkey .
i saw one once that could do sign language .
yeah koko .
slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual . in fact even some of them have moved on they 're doing sign language now .
hey . wh where are you ?
did you two break up ?
rust proofing ?
finder 's fee ? it was on the lot .
so listen puddy . when we first started this deal i thought things were going to be different . now if you want to play hard ball i got my friend george here and he can play pretty hard ball . george vein it up .
george would you help me please ?
sing it sister .
elaine .
you 're going to get back together anyway . it 's thousands of dollars .
fine .
all right . lunch .
no no . no elaine the car can wait . what 's important is you two getting back together . eh then we 'll talk about the car .
okay . now i know this is an important decision . why do n't we all just sit down and talk about it ? come on come on . now look you both find each other attractive right ?
all right . now what do i have to do to put you two in a relationship today ?
so you 're back together ?
so puddy wear 's a man fur ?
and of course you find fur morally reprehensible .
kramer said it 's a perfect gift . that 's what we 're getting him .
what ?
that 's a five .
maybe cheapness is a sense . you know it is better without this big wallet . it 's more comfortable .
but look at this thing . it 's it 's huge . you got more cow here than here .
show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster .
george i am loving this no wallet thing .
hey joe mayo . nice place .
did you at least get him a card ?
it 's working . do n't tap on the glass .
because you threw it out .
what was that ?
no because it 's so stupid . shall we ?
ow . sharp key .
not more of that crap from the titanic ?
oh .
i do n't know .
hey george did you get joe mayo that chair yet ?
what ?
uh yeah i think i do . i can never find anything in here . ah here it is . so that joe mayo throws the worst parties does n't he ? so what was your job ?
i have to do what ?
i 'm not wearing the fur .
that 's my walkman .
i do n't understand . why did n't you tell us you had it ?
your good friend is morbidly obese .
it 's not a purse . it 's european .
oh thanks .
maybe this is n't my coat .
hey . officer . someone took my european carryall .
so your saying unicef is a scam ?
she should just give up .
kramer .
i do n't either .
you 've been hiding her from us . you must really like her ?
she does stink and she should quit . but i do n't want it to be because of me . it should be the traditional route years of rejections and failures till she 's spit out the bottom of the porn industry .
what are you doing ? do n't tell a woman she looks like a man and george does n't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do i
sally you ca n't quit the business . this is all because of me .
you ca n't give up . you do n't think people tell me i stink ? when i 'm on stage that 's all i hear you stink you suck . we like magic .
of course i stink you stink . it 's show bizz . everybody stinks
all right i think we 've covered my act . now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else .
it 's ludicrous
what 's happening ? what you doing come and talk to us .
lets talk about that .
oh . shut up .
good luck it 's sold out for the next three weeks .
wow . that 's incredible but you do n't draw .
what your sad little horsies the house with the little curl of smoke the sunflower with the smiley face . the transparent cube

get out of my house . .
it 's a pig at a complain department .
i thought you stopped talking ?
you broke up with her just because she cut her hair . how short ?
so she
and you do n't
no no hey uh you want to see a movie ?
i think that 's for the best .
well what is it ?
ah alright four . seinfeld .
so did i do a terrible thing ?
hey i offered you those cookies in my house .
excuse me did n't those people just come in ? i believe we were ahead of them .
seinfeld .
boy you are really hungry .
she looks so familiar .
they wo n't do anything in fact you 'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives .
what happened ?
i told my uncle i had a stomach ache tonight . you think he bought that ?
you said this to her after .
oh boy .
who is that woman ? .
didja leave a message ?
where do i know her ?
oh you know working around same stuff doing whatever .
i 'm sorry lorraine this is elaine

no no no you see the girl there with the long hair ?
well what do you suggest ?
so you 're not going ?
that 's good .
so what 's this guy about ?
no go ahead .
oh come on .
this is your hiding place ? .
here . i 'm going to try and fix the buzzer .
hey
george the buzzer 's broken . i 'll come down .
i believe this belongs to you .
where did you get that ?
i 'm sorry . i i do n't know you .
there 's been some robberies in the building . i i ca n't let you in .
is that guy still there ?
we do n't hear that .
so i guess i 'll s
so when are you giving boxcar willie his walking papers ?
same situation . pay him off and you 're clean .
really ? how come you never pursued her before ?
there 's a giant parrot in the hallway .
hi . is phil here ?
so you 're in a relationship with a woman you do n't like and you 're having an affair with a woman that wo n't have sex with you .
but i i did n't i
kramer they think i killed fredo . and who buries a bird ?
just get the key and let 's get out of here .
kramer i need those cufflinks but now they 're in the box and the key is in the bird what are we going to do ?
kramer i ca n't believe we 're grave robbers .
oh my god . here he is . i do n't want to dig him up .
ah i 'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building .
what 's his last name ?
if he 's black .
uh one second .
with the little legs ?
how much are they paying you ?
well as long as i 'm up . dad i got you a birthday present . here . happy birthday .
nah i got it from a guy on the street . it was like fifty bucks .
could be .
and you can do everything with it . you can get e mail fax there 's a calculator .
not you . older people .
if you feed him he 'll never leave .
dad it 's got lots of other functions .
oh right . you ca n't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo .
so did you figure out darryl 's you know .
he wants to install kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes . preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse .
oh no .
george listen to me . i have a very important job for you . i want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets do n't dry out and leak .
hey dad . you know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin . dad you look so different .
you know you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner .
kramer these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here sit in the heat pretend it 's not hot and enforce these rules .
wizards .
kramer
down here ?
aw .
a willard ? saccamano sr . screwed me .
dad i 'm sorry .
and then ?
so you prefer dumb and lazy to religious ?
i dunno . since the last one . oh here she is . you want to meet her ?
hey mickey . check the pepper shaker .
do medical schools actually do this ?
would you hold it a second ? . thank you will you get out of here with that stuff ?
oh i knew it was you i was joking . i 'm a comedian .
i hear things . hey so sophie gave me the it 's me on the phone today .
no no . he 's pretending he 's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it .
yes . step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row .
so what 's going on ?
yeah i better get to a doctor bye . that was close . what drives me to take chances like that ?
she said there 's some tractor story that she has n't told me about .
no one 's stealing a tractor it 's a five mile an hour getaway . we 're dancing around the obvious it 's got to be disfigurement .
i do n't know .
that seems about right .
they should update these pieces nobody rides horses anymore . maybe they should change it to a tractor .
shh . shh . shh . it 's not important . what 's important is i 'm not going to let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long term and meaningful relationship .
first it was the health club then the supermarket now the bookstore . they could put it anywhere they want no one 's meeting anybody .
you better hurry .
uncle leo .
sleeping in the caragain ?
ah the drunken make out . an office classic . did you end up xeroxing anything ?
what 's your position ?
as opposed to a spirited bout of skanko roman wrestling .
oh hey . can i fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches ?
no he does n't .
yes it can .
you could get arrested .
thank you .
i do n't believe this . excuse me i wonder if you could do me a favor ? my uncle 's having a little problem with shoplifting
NUM NUM ? that that 's just a scare right ?
hello ?
prison . i 'm sure it 's just a fine .
prior convictions ? leo ?

you 're stealing too ? .
mom you too ?
alright i 'll talk to you later .
to the idiotmobile .
uncle leo . hello .
i 'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book .
that book has been on a wild ride . george took it into the bathroom with him and
hello ?
uncle leo ?
i want everyone out .
i 'd like to speak with the manager please .
you defile one book steal another ask for your money back and to you that 's even ?
yes . my uncle leo was cought shoplifing here the other day
oh come on . he 's just a lonely old man . all old people steal .
that guy . swarm . swarm .
why are n't you there now ?
you know i should n't go out with a friend of yours . i foresee messiness .
where did you get this ?
you sure have a lot of friends . how come i never see any of these people ?
so they just gave you this ?
how come i have n't read about this ?
all right make it the large sodas .
i 'll tell you lisi i never expected that movie to
not as long .
well it was nice meeting you . i 'm sure i 'll see you
fabulous . see now you 're really do something .
hey how you going to keep the machine plugged in while you move it ?
oh come on . there 's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me .
she 's a sentence finisher . it 's like dating mad libs .
so join in .
all right .
really bad meal . i was thinking maybe we should
well i 'm calling this off right now .
hi lisi .
you are not dumb . do n't say that
these beans are pretty good .
oh thank god . why is it dark out ? what time is it ?
lopper .
great . uh you know what ? why do n't you put it in the car so i do n't toss it in that dumpster ?
a long long weekend .
game over .
i was screaming at hecklers all night . the last time i open for a rodeo .
oh i had that coming to me .
you do n't have to whisper . she knows she 's a maid .
i hired her from a service .
notice what ? she 's not really even a maid .
well cindy the place looks great .
she 's not a maid . she might be a news woman .
really ? it 's tuesday here . what day is it there ?
no t bone ?
no . there 's no t bone .
yeah . it 's in your closet .
well it 's probably the most intelligent ape there is .
ooh .
i was talking to him .
i said never mind .
oh she did n't mind ?
hey that 's great .
$NUM seems kind of steep for a nap .
ho ho ho . hold on . let 's keep this sophisticated .
oh yeah ? well then we 're through . and you 're fired .
well what happened ?
just wait there . i 'll pick you up and kramer stay alive no matter what occurs i will find you .
yeah .
you know she did n't really do what she was supposed to do .
hey come on . come on . i got to live around here .
keep your shirt on . i got it .
look at this guy . he 's trying to box me out .
yeah . they should make a movie about all the hindenburg flights that made it .
imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you 'd yelled that out at the actual disaster .
i do n't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking . it makes me anxious .
but that 's a one way street coming this way . besides how am i going to get all the way over there ?
they 're not letting me in .
the stare ahead . i hate that . i use it all the time .
maroon golf .
could you move your car back a little ?
i do n't know .
what 's that ?
ok .
i 'm glad i cut you off because black saab rules . so long jackass .
so if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time we can do this . all right on the count of three . can everyone hear me ? hey amigo are you paying attention ?
i do n't know .
what seems to be the problem officer ?
oh . it 's back .
yeah . would n't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror faster and faster getting more and more intense until finally
oh . it 's in your eye now .
you were watchin ? where ?
oh that was a strike . did you see that ? .
balk ? . how was that a balk ? . you have any snacks ?
mr . vandelay of course .
my car .
i love a parade .
take some of mine .
look at that guy . i 'll bet you he 's getting hair transplants . any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap ten to one plugs .
oh one more thing about the car . let it warm up for a minute .
elaine is having a houseguest . she 's picking him up at the airport tonight .
everybody 's moving to seattle .
well from what i can piece together our friend here met a gentleman .
so they went out a few times but apparently when the fellow returned home he discovered that the benes tattoo does not wash off so easily .
so he 's coming in to stay with her for a week .
i did n't say anything .
he 'll probably kill his family over this .
maybe i 'll try that pesto .
busboys are always changing jobs . that 's the business . i know . i work with these guys . i tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs .
kramer says it 's up to the cat now . it 'll be on your conscience .
so . so the last person in should close the door .
no hello ?
so you two been uh
anywhere in the city ?
okay fifty fourth and sixth ?
it was that fall down the stairs . that 's what did it .
first of all i ca n't believe that people actually do fight . people have fist fights in life . i ca n't really believe that we have boxing either . it 's really kind of an amazing thing . to me the problem with boxing is you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument . why do n't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars drive around a bit have a little accident ? they get out did n't you see my signal ? look at that fender . then you 'd see a real fight .
i think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food . how could you ever enjoy a meal like that ? i 'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue .
oh i 'm sure she did i 'm sure they 're impeccable . i 'm talking about the ones that forge `em .
you know i think this is really helping .
i 'm in the middle of a story .
yes it was .
take it .
hey would you stop it already ?
i do n't know she actually seemed to get a little paranoid .
not if you have a doctor 's note .
you took your pants off ?
maybe it just wanted to change positions ? you know shift to the other side .
that 's not the test . contact is the test if it moves as a result of contact .
hey .
i never said i 'd do that .
alright alright .
roy should we go ? is this a breach of our friendship ?
what is the matter with you ?
no appointments at all ?
hello ? oh hi roy . what ? oh my god . wel how did this happen ? what can i do ? oh . i am so sorry . okay . bye . that was roy . he 's under investigation for insurance fraud .
you what ?
why 'd you do that ?
neither did you that 's how he got caught . we sent in four notes from two doctors .
hi pam .
i just thought ahh maybe i could talk to roy if um
no it 's
okay . i mean what if the
i mean i 'm happy sometimes but but not now .
oh please i love her .
well what 's the next move what 's going to happen now ?
yeah i know she 's mad at me but i really have to speak with her .
but you see let me just talk to you for a second see what i did is inadvertently sent an insurance
ca n't you just listen to me ?
the police ?
did he say anything ?
oh my god it 's
having a cup of coffee .
wow . look at him . the yankee clipper
kramer dating your room mate . it 's funny .
those brave krakatoans east of java . who sacrifice so much for so long .
no that 's krama .
an old friend of mine whom you may have met george costanza has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the irs . and as we speak at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information . and she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise .
and there 's so much more to go .
so what happened ? you gave her my tax papers ? my papers ?
how is that possible ?
ok wait a second wait a second what happened to my papers ?
yeah i know champagne limos cigars . what happened to the papers ?
is that relevant ? she took them . call her office .
not good
completely naked ?
so what now ?
my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time . he came over to my house for dinner . there was no soda and he went bezerk . he was screaming where 's the pepsi where 's the pepsi ? '
tuberculosis
it 's one stupid thing after another . so let me ask you when you come to one of these places what do you bring your pocketbook ?
there are no copies .
who makes copies ?
hey there 's the old man .
what 's the difference ?
nothing . it 's a fine car . what if you want to use it ?
it 's not a speech . do i have to make a speech ?
oh yeah that will go over real well with that crowd .
what about him ?
na that 's not such a good idea .
but you know look at the sun dried tomatoes . where were they five years ago ? it just goes to show you . you never know what huh you know huh what could happen to a vegetable . it could just take right off at any time . we 've tried all kind of arrangements but we ca n't seem to be friends when we sleep together .
nice to see you . this is elaine .
we 're going scuba diving . we 'll be back in time .
i do n't think so .
what kind of pen is that ?
i ca n't take it .
no i 'm not
ok thank you very much . thank you . gee boy .
if he likes it so much he never should have offered it .
so you want me to return it ?
oh no do n't say that . you 'll jinx me .
stay on biscayne .
yes . generally that 's where scuba diving is done .
you ca n't go ?
we 'll stay in a hotel tonight .
i 'm buying you a new sofa .
evelyn this is elaine .
all i said was i like the peng .
is it my imagination or is it freezing in here ?
yeah and i got about ten feet down and i felt this tremendous pressure on my mask . like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets .
is n't he supposed to be the emcee ?
well there 's really no point in me staying . i mean you just going to be
well today 's almost over . and weekdays always go by fast . friday we 're leaving . it 's like two days really . it 's like a cup of coffee . it will go by like that .
so i 'm on the plane we left late . pilot says we 're going to be making up some time in the air . i thought well is n't that interesting . we 'll just make up time . that 's why you have to reset your watch when you land . of course when they say they 're making up time obviously they 're increasing the speed of the aircraft . now my question is if you can go faster why do n't you just go as fast as you can all the time ? c 'mon there 's no cops up here nail it . give it some gas . we 're flying .
do i what ?
yes i pick it up .
well you have to .
two hundred seats on a plane i got to wind up next to yukon jack and his dog cujo . shut up . one more day and you are pound bound .
you . i 'm talking about people .
no i ca n't i got to watch farfel you and george can go without me .
sure .
on my block a lot of ah people walk their dogs and i always see them walking along with their little poop bags which to me is just the lowest function of human life . if aliens are watching this through telescopes they 're going to think the dogs are the leaders . if you see two life forms one of them 's making a poop the other one 's carrying it for him who would you assume was in charge ?
bad dog . bad dog . you go outside . outside . what do you want from me ? tell me . money you want money ? i 'll give you money how much ? .

any day that you had gym it was a weird school day you know what i mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal . you have like english geometry social studies and then suddenly you 're like in lord of the flies for NUM minutes you know you 're hanging from a rope . you have hardly any clothes on . teachers are yelling at ya where 's your jock strap ? ya know and kids are throwing dodge balls at you . you 're trying to survive then its history science language . there 's something off in the entire flow of that day .
of course we 'll hit traffic . it 's rush hour .
i have to go to the bathroom . why do they hide the bathroom in these malls ?
you want me to help you with that ?
i thought it was green . i remember seeing green .

him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place . you want to call the department of social services ? oh it 's saturday . they 're closed today . my luck .
first of all you do n't even know technically that i went . that 's for starters . i mean i couldo ve been pouring a bottle of water out there . you do n't know .

hey how 'd you do on that iq test ?
oh it 's nothing

why are you doing this ?
well yes i did that 's true . a couple of a guys i knew in the coastguard told me about her and i sensed that she had the anger and intensity that i needed to make this film work .
she was sitting at the table where i had my tape recorder okay great . thanks again bye . ha ha who do these women think they 're dealing with ? did she think she was going to leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and i was just going to let it go . not bloody likely

she wants to be an actress . she makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her and i do it because i 'm so addicted to the sex i 'm helpless i 'll do anything . so finally kramer comes in the other day .
i do n't want to see this woman anymore but i have n't got the will power to throw out her number . please help me . help me .

no .
i 'm not swearing . i do n't want to swear .
no .
i did n't tell her you stupid idiot . she tricked you .
they had smooth trails . what about the cumberland gap ?
i know enough not to get on them .
george ?
i would say when the nipple makes its first appearance .
nice try . so guess who heckled me at the club last night .
but in a way i think i inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic . i hate being around alcoholics because they 're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you . and those are the two statements that scare me the most . but i think he 's okay now because i have no idea how he feels about me . he 's finally off the wagon .
remember do n't whistle on the elevator .

ask george to go with you .
oh anthony quinn fine actor . but from what i understand not a very good driver . hits everything on the road . but always leaves a note .
kirk douglas . now there 's another very bad driver . but he 's such an unbelievable guy that when he hits someone he does n't even leave a note . he sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license registration and apologize .
come on up .
what if she 's having an off night ?
hi .
can i take a sweater ?
what car ?
i 've had a crush on this woman for year . i 've always been afraid to approach her . she looks like she belongs on one of these hallmark cards .
i 'm not religious but i certainly know where to draw the line .
do n't sell yourself short saying god bless you to every tom dick and harry in great personal risk .
you 're telling me .

typical things .
now bear in mind i am just trying to keep up .

she flipped out . just left .
look the main thing is i do n't want elaine to know about any of this . i mean especially the panty remark . i mean it 's embarrassing . and she 's never let me hear the end of it .
i guess he failed to see the humor in it .
let 's go .

the hardest part about being a clown it seems to me would be that you 're constantly referred to as a clown . who was that clown ? ' i 'm not working with that clown did you hire that clown ? ' the guy 's a clown . . how do you even start into being a clown how do you know that you want to be a clown i guess you get to a point where you 're pants look so bad it 's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done . because if you think about it a clown if there is n't a circus around them is really just a very annoying person . you 're in the back seat of this guys volkswagen what you 're picking somebody else up ? oh man . '

what are you crazy ? .
where i go ? you mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national tv and i said yes ? .
but i i did n't know what she was talking about . i could n't hear her .
but i do n't want to be a pirate .
i have to wear it . the woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on tv they 're producing them as we speak .
uh huh yeah .
you know if you talked this loud to begin with i would n't be in this costume in the first place .
yeah .
it did n't do me any good either . that benefit was the worst show i ever did . some of those heckles were really uncalled for avast ye matey what the hell does that mean ? . NUM degrees off the starboard side the spanish galleon . there 's no comeback for that .
hey .
beautiful .
so you 're tunneling to the center of the earth ?
he was running from a bee .
come on george . pick a face and go with it .
are you okay ? did he bite ya ?
what 's the matter ?
amy and jeffrey ?
we 're going to have to talk about this later . thank you . taxi .
why not ? they could have met . she loves the park he works for the parks department .
there is n't ?
why ?
it 's coming . it 's a commando NUM . NUM . NUM btu 's . it 's going to be like a meat locker in here .
i was an idiot for listening to you .
a bad side an ugly side .
who picked these out ?
take it to the window .
well i 'm very mysterious by nature . a lot of women find that attractive .
uncle leo ? .
unlce leo what are you doing here ?
oh really ?
that 's right lady .
so how did you meet him ?
so he 's a writer .
that 's barry prophet he 's our accountant .
what you got a cold ?
did you see that ?
what was all that sniffing ?
i do n't know .
all i know he was sniffing .
i know .
do you think that 's a bad sign ?
a call for one you know i thought i 've heard everything . i 've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation .
good idea .
yes i 'd like to speak to barry prophet please .
i 'll call back thank you . he went to south america .
who goes to south america ?
hello newman .
all right shut up the both of you . you 're making me nervous . where is he already ? he shouldo ve been out of work by now .
yeah maybe you should .
i might need you to get me a soda .
not even once ?
you 're an idiot .
dear barry . consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately . '
mohair i think .
you mean you just started sniffing ?
the what ?
yeah i looked . i saw .
no uncomfortable ? not at all . my friendo s wife 's breast sticking out why would that make me uncomfortable ?
so after the sucking comes the weaning .
well you got to wean .
yeah i saw the spot .
george
ya NUM .
me ? godfather ?
well maybe we should .
maybe they 're admiring your spot .
you mean that was n't uh .
what now ?
hey george you ever see one ?
so what 'd you think ?
maybe he 's just a guy with a nose like this . you know a lot of people have a nose like this they 're not necessarily pig men .
alright kramer enough of this . let 's go find george .
where 's the mohel ?
hello .
yeah . i 'm holding the baby .
flinched ? i did not flinch . george did i flinch ?
who 's got a tissues ? i need more tissues . look at this thing . it 's my phone finger .
a few stitches ? i 've never had stitches . i 'll be deformed . i ca n't live with that . it goes against my whole personality . it 's not me .
look at this .
you got a problem with paba ?
a party is a bad date situation . it does n't matter who you 're with . you could be with j . edgar hoover . you do n't want to sit and talk with hoover all night . you want to circulate . ho ho ho .
well i would think with the law enforcement and the cross dressing . seems like an interesting guy .
not the croat the lineswoman . that is the most beautiful lineswoman i 've ever seen .
b . l . ?
i got to talk to her . what do you think ?
i 'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals .
i do n't know hi .
excuse me . excuse me ? oh that 's nice . that 's right ignore me . that 's real polite . yea nobody 's even talking to you . all you big lineswoman . oh you 've got some kind of a cool job . i know your type thinking your too good for everyone but it 's women like you oh well what are you deaf ?
ca n't hear a thing .
wow good plan .
that 's nice .
why do n't you get him some tickets or something how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency .
kramer i think perhaps you 've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity . it 's ball boys not ball men . there are no ball men .
but i thought things were going great .
so she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it ? you really think she would be that superficial ?
well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place who withdraws ? what 's the etiquette ?
really .
well i do n't care i do n't want to go anyway . i do n't want to fight that traffic on friday night .
why ? well what are you doing ?
oh uh do you want to come with us ?
she reads lips .
all right .
so i really had a good time .
well six and sex are close .
you 're kidding .
uh just pull over right there by the stop sign .
i know it .
suave . and it 's non fat .
you know kramer 's going to clean up on this place .
who is it ?
how did you know ?
boy it 's hard to believe with all that biting experience a person could still make a mistake like that .
maybe your yogurt is n't so non fat .
there must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing .
well let 's start the insanity .
and they said they can do it ?
all right . let 's go down to the yogurt store and we 'll get a specimen .
it was an accident . i 'm going to talk to him .
oh you do n't know what you 're talking about .
you call me fatso one more time you 're going to be walking back .
oh .
because she 's like the jury . she 's going to be sequestered .
that 's enough .
he said that ?
why do you say that ?
oh i see . so you can go hey you know who i saw wilding today ? herb . '
it had fat in it it 's not good for you .
so in effect the yogurt won him the election .
of course was the last thing he said ?
so if you call and ask if you have the job you might lose the job .
shower ?
okay .
no actually i was just going to
well i do n't want to take too much off .
i ca n't . he loves me . he says i 'm his most loyal customer . plus he 's right there on the corner . i 'd have to pass him every day when i go by .
he was in the shop . i thought you told me he was n't going to be there .
what do you mean you show up ?
well you 'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs .
yeah i see what you mean . i forgot who i was dealing with here .
so it 's a nice place to work ?
what about your boss ? the guys you interviewed you ?
i got a haircut .
oh . thank you .
yeah .
enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor .
who do you know ? he knows my hair .
okay okay .
what 's wrong with yours ?
all right ?
i 'm watching edward scissorhands .
if you want to watch sit down . you 're making me nervous . i tell you this scissorhands is a hell of a barber .
i do n't get this scissorhands . what is he supposed to be like a super hero like green lantern or somebody ? what 's with this guy ? just asking .
who is it ?
oh my god he knows . go . one second .
no i was n't there .
sample ? newman . uh i was there but i was just dropping off a book .
no eight years is n't such a long streak .
no i have n't vomited in thirteen years .
yes because my previous vomit was also june NUM NUM . that 's why during the NUM vomit i was yelling to george can you believe it ? i 'm vomiting on june NUM again .
ask him to change it .
hey did you hear that george got back with karen ?
he feels he 's funnier more relaxed .
yeah . let 's go .
yeah . good seeing you again karen .
yeah me either .
yeah .
i was blowing on the coffee .
yes .
not everybody likes everybody .
oh no . that was the dry heaves .
kramer .
i 'll see you tonight .
ahh . they 're out .
because if i ca n't get one you 're not getting one .
i 'm sorry kramer .
that 's final .
what 's the matter with you ?
you just had one yesterday . what do you need another one for ?
well did you get the ball ?
well i never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game .
just checking it out . look at how this thing is made . can i tell you something ? that 's a hell of a piece of equipment .
no nonsense . this one 's fine .
no . yes you can .
come on . i know it 's something you want to do .
look who are you kidding ? you come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils and i 'm not supposed to expect anything ? you 're a massage teaser .
fine . go .
you need to talk ?
george anything you have to say to her you can say in front of me .
what ?
george . i would n't push for the massage .
what 's the big rush ?
who ?
alright i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
what about what about this thing ?
surprise .
it 's a cigar store indian . read the card .
we had a little fight this afternoon . let 's bury the hatchet . we smoke um peace pipe .
uhm listen i really felt bad about what happened and i i i 'd really like to apologise . can i come up ?
i did n't know that
ah she kinda calmed down . i talked to her today . in fact i 'm going to see her tonight .
hello .
i 'll see you later .
i uh i uh i arranged for the appropriate accommodations . and then knick tickets floor seats .
thanks .
yeah .
i thought it was a pretty good idea . it 's about coffee tables it 's on a coffee table .
you ca n't give something and then take it back . i mean what are you
i 'm sorry i 'm not familiar with that term .
i was always excited as a kid when that new tv guide would come . somehow when that front cover 's nice and flat seems like there 's good fresh tv shows in . then as the weeks go by you start to hate the tv guide . all the shows stink . everything 's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on thrown across the room . tv guide is always thrown never handed to another person . it 's the worldo s most thrown reading material . where 's tv guide ? there it is . you know in the back of the tv guide they have a phone number ninety five cents a minute they will give you the answers to the tv guide crossword puzzle ? my question is if you ca n't do the tv guide crossword puzzle where are you coming across ninety five cents ?
mmm succulent .
oh i do n't know . not always . no i uh i had to work at it . when i was a kid all the kids would be out playing i would be up in my room practicing my kissing .
to wash my hands . they 're sticky from the orange .
exactly
i said i was coming down with the flu or something and i had to go home .
but that 's what podiatrists do . they deal in fungus . they 're knee deep in fungus . this guy knows fungus .
that 's all there is to it .
what do you mean she liked you ?
you picked up on a vibe from a nun .
oh hi .
bye .
yeah but there 's a problem . i found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet .
so i do n't know what she 's using it for .
yeah i 've got this old bottle of cough medicine .
hi . can i use your bathroom ?
not on purpose . i was hoping there would be a name on the tube . when are you seeing him again ?
how could you say that ?
i was merely speaking extemporaneously .
what ?
who ?
wow
but once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you 're never using it again . any medicine you 're using is on the sink . it 's not really even a medicine cabinet it 's really like an ointment museum is n't it ? it 's like here 's a saff from NUM some cream from the NUMs . but you want to keep it private because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out . somebody peeks in there oh i see mr . perfect needs tough acting tinactin . well i guess i 'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on . '
hmm i love this artificial flavoring i like it better than butter i think it 's more consistent
what ?
who do you think she is ? how dare she ? you want me to get the manager ? too bad they do n't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we 'd flush her out
hey
what 's the matter with yours ?
why do you do that ?
oh with huh pretty boy tony
huh huh
it 's battle conditions
yeah
hey you know it 's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
no i got to go downtown
yeah
i mean every time i see him it 's tony this tony that . george is like a school girl around him
yeah yeah what is it with you and tony ? what are you ? it 's like his sidekick now ?
yeah so ?
oh look at that i got oil all over me . can i have your napkin ?
who was it ?
trust me nah it 's good
she 's one of these people always have to be different
yeah it 's a damn shame a damn shame .
yeah without a doubt i 'm down oh hey how 're you doing ? jane this is my neighbor kramer
ok .
who ?
oh i 'm sorry i did n't get most of that is n't that kramer over there ?
hey kramer
how 's you get her to meet here ?
how can u say things like that over the phone ?
selling sexual pleasure over the phone ?
now of the course the thing is extreme sports . bungie jumping . to me if bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy . just leaning does not make it a sport . it 's like a wiley coyote idea is n't it ? the thing i wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets ? can you almost make it ? why do n't they just wear a party hat ? what 's the difference ? you jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute does n't open i got news for you the helmet is now wearing you for protection . later on the helmet 's talking to the other helmets going boy it 's a good thing he was there or i would have hit the ground directly .
it 's pathetic . . . . hey is it cold out ?
that .
look at this
mmm . oh look elaine the black and white cookie .
i 'm looking forward to it .
so listen elaine when we get up to the door you you hold the cake box .
well we saw you come in .
oh so you still do n't believe us .
another babka ?
what ?
oh oh take it back . let 's get another one .
well i 'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it .
a little hair ? do you think that makes it better ?
what if it 's your hair ?
who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store . i use prell the hard stuff . hundred proof takes your roots out .
well i started screaming there 's a hair in my farina . there 's a hair in my farina . then i ran out of the house and i was running and running . and like i was little but i could run very fast . and i i just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site .
my mother 's .

george .
elaine see this t shirt six years i 've had this t shirt . it 's my best one i call him golden boy .
but see look at the collar it 's fraying . golden boy is slowly dying . each wash brings him one step closer that 's what makes the t shirt such a tragic figure .
you want to barrow golden boy .
that 's were they got it from .
she does n't open ?
is n't that against the law ?
it 's a mammal .
yeah let me just stop by the cash machine and i 'll meet you over at the coffee shop .

she looked great .

oh get out of here .
it was a thank you card from kristin because i 'm doing the pbs drive . i mean how long am i supposed to keep it ?
you making that up or do you know what you 're talking about ?
well i 'm doing the pbs show so during the show they 're going to be running the ken burns baseball thing . so i thought if i could get a baseball player to come on the show with me

you know what ? it sounds like the friend of elaine 's that was hitting on me in the book store .
my nana ?
you know i saw someone on the street eating m&ms with a spoon .
i 'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in a little
yeah i guess .
all right let 's move it out .
i 've never seen him in manhattan before it 's weird . so out of context .
i believe he is wearing a cape .
you 're right it is strange . in fact let 's cross to the other side of the street . cover me .
just uh plop it on the counter there .
oh . i got a message .
let me call him back hello ? who is this ? donna chang ? oh i 'm sorry i must o dialed the wrong number .
i 'm sorry kramer . those records are permanently sealed
really ? you never slipped one past the goalie in all these years ? boy i 'm surprised . you 've slept with a lot of women .
well i 'm sure you 're not totally depleted .
so go to a fertility clinic . have your sperm count checked .
paul again ?
i tried . your line 's crossed with a chinese woman .
no . jacket and tie no cape .
who are you ?
i did n't think so .
well it 's false advertising see ? and the thing is i think she likes people thinking she 's chinese . she suggests chinese food . she always introduces herself as donna chang
well she is a woman .
hey would n't it be funny if paul ang noreen broke up because o you kept hanging up on him ?
well i 'm going to have to move now .
i thought you said ridicurous .
did i ?
do n't you see what 's going on here ? no boxers no jockeys
first you ruin her relationship with the high talker .
so she breaks up with him . somehow picks up the pieces of her life . miraculously meets a new guy . ya bust that up . ang then just as they 're reconciling you announce to the world he 's boring .
well apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does .
well let 's look back at your history with this woman . okay ?
why ? what happened ?
wow . that 's amazing .
confucius huh ?
elaine was in a rush .
well noreen listened to you like george 's mother listened to the chinese .
so what 's your first book ?
oh sure truman capote .
oh what about this one ? look at this this is it . this is what i 'm looking for . oh yeah .

yeah . so do i .
uh no . should i have ?
i ca n't wait .
clever .

so you wo n't eat the pizza ?
really .
well what if poppie felt the same way ?
really .
oh boy .
well i 'm certainly glad i brought it up .
no games ? what is the point of dating without games ? how do you know if you 're winning or losing ?
well you should probably ask because if he 's going to be coming over with those paccino 's pizzas could be trouble .
hey what 's happenin . '
you got a regular manhattan project going on over there .
okay . hi poppie .
okay . i 'll get it .
here you go . anyway i 'm sorry again about the the the

i thought consumer said volvo was the car .

let me get a clean pair .
they 're uncomfortable .
oh yeah ? huh .
i 'm calling elaine . see if she can find out anything from tim whatley .
except jon is spelled with an h . j o h n .

ready to go lois ?
excuse me lois . stand back lois . jimmy 's in trouble lois .
hi oh .
she could n't make it .
he was down at the other end . so he yells out ready on your mark get set and i was so keyed up i just took off . by the time he said go i was ten yards ahead of everybody .
oh so am i . uh how 's duncan ?
oh nothing in particular .
oh he 's just jealous because he came in second .
i could n't tell her the truth . i do n't know what 's going to happen between us . what if we have a bad breakup . she 'll go straight to duncan . and i want him to go to his grave never being certain i got that
yours or hers ?
duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow . he obviously wants me to admit i got a head start . and i do n't think she believes me .
that 's not bad .
i did n't hit puberty til the NUM grade . that 's what gave me my speed . besides if i got a head start why did n't mr . bevilacqua stop the race ?
yeah yeah well you really got bald there did n't you ?
you really used to have a think full head of hair .
george .
no no no another race out of the question .
hello oh hi duncan NUM NUM o'clock tomorrow ? that is not going to work . . . . why ? i 'll tell you why . because i chose not to run .
come on . lets go
what 's it doin here ?
he 's fantastic .
you loaned her pitt 's racquet ?
bye bye
hm really ?
in a manner of speaking .
kramer you 're going to have to face her some time
yeah
so when do you have to get the racquet back to mr . pitt ?
he needs a three hundred dollar bruline to beat ethyl kennedy ?
so what happened with kramer 's mother ?
hi is sandy here ?
i would except i forgot to bring a towel .
so as you can see i 've got a bit of a problem here .
the switch . '
i could n't do it without you .
all right . so i tell sandy that i want to have a m&eacute nage &agrave trois with her and her roommate .
and you believe this course of action will have a two pronged effect . firstly the very mention of the idea will cause sandy to recoil in disgust whereupon she will insist that i remove myself from the premises .
at this point it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events .
huh . well it all sounds pretty good . there 's only one flaw in it they 're roommates . she 'd have to go out with me behind sandy 's back . she 's not going to do that .
uh ?
ah that 's a shame .
yeah i did . in fact i went over there .
what are you talking about ? i 'm not going to do it .
do n't you know what it means to become an orgy guy ? it changes everything . i 'd have to dress different . i 'd have to act different . i 'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and i 'd need a new bedspread and new curtains i 'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting . i 'd have to get new friends . i 'd have to get orgy friends . naw i 'm not ready for it .
oh shut up you could n't do it either .
what do you mean you got caught ?
you sure you do n't want the tickets ?
i ca n't the drake put me in the wedding party .
maybe he did n't know ?
row f in front of the gs hobnobbing with the ds and es .
here . two tickets . have a good time .
what is it ?
take what ?
so why do n't you leave it at newman 's ?
tim whatley ?
or maybe he liked your gift so much he decided to get me the same thing . perhaps it 's an homage .
he repeated the name of the gift ?
oh well if you repeat the name of the gift you ca n't possibly like it .
why 'd you get him a gift anyway ?
yeah well if you 're getting him anything for his birthday i 'm alarge .
well maybe he 's
what 's stopping them ?
i know you would drape yourself in velvet .
oh maybe he 's got no hot water .
are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving ? there 's no grace period .
thanks .
i dunno watch it on tv i guess . why ?
what 's his name ?
then how 'd you get up there ?
obviously .
yeah well i do n't trust this guy . i think he regifted he degifted and now he 's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a super bowl sex romp .
hey . what are you doing ?
my door ?
so she kicked him out of the apartment .
that 's not a good role for you .
you unwittingly made a major commitment . that 's a lot of pressure .
where are you going ?
thanks for having me over guys .
alright i 'll see you later .
ah tim whatley . out scalping ?
can you move over at all ? .
hey .
oh yeah i knew .
i do n't know .
oh yeah he 's fine fine . he was in bad shape for a while though .
he swore me to secrecy .
it 's not like you 're my wife .
hey believe me you were better off not knowing . it 's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this . i was so nice to him i almost made myself sick .
his illness is your business .
if not now when ?
do you ever win at poker ?
oh my god you got a flush . you 're holding a flush .
so what was wrong with him ?
so you 're telling me because you 're getting free parking i got to pretend this guy had cancer when he did n't ?
well i do n't like it . i do n't like it one bit . and i 'm supposed to see him tomorrow .
i do n't think so .
okay .
hey . look at you . wha what 's this ?
you look like a pirate .
ca n't see on your right side ?
hey do you know what the whip does ?
yeah .
because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee .
she thinks a guy who lies about a life threatening illness so he can get some phony hair has perspective ?
so you keep it a secret your whole life then at your funeral the mortician comes out here mrs costanza i thought you might want this . aahh .
you know gary i had a little chat with george the other day
