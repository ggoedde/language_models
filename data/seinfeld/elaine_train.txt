oh forget it i hate those . everytime i take one the driver will not stop talking to me . no matter how disinterested i seem he just keeps yakking away . blah blah blah blah blah . why does everything always have to have a social componant ? now a stage coach that would have been a good situation for me . cause i 'm in the coach and the driver is way up there on the stage .
we are that means that we ah we are
you talked about a lot of things ? well
you want to meet her . you want to see if she likes you ?
hey you guys listen to this . listen to this . apparently some blood spilled into mr . giuliani 's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be NUM points higher than was initially reported . ironically the mishap by bringing the non fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public probably clinched the election for the republican . it was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept giuliani into office .
they have big salads .
you were ?
anything else ? what do you mean anything else ?
kramer what is wrong with you ?
well ? we 've been dating for three months . between you and me and anyone else you want to tell .

wow . you really have a terrible voice .
i do n't know . they 're taking a nap or something .

what ? that ? s why i came all the way over here .
i think they went out to dinner .
oh how would he know . he blacked out . he fainted .
well he said he 'd drive me here right after . so i am sitting in his car twenty minutes . he does n't come down . i am freezing . then a cop comes by tells me to get out of the car . he 's a city marshal . he 's towing the car away . kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets . he was going to tow it with me in the car . so they tow the car . now i am standing outside and i am freezing but i cannot leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car . so finally he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves . he said he was getting special instructions that each dove has a different diet so we 're wandering around trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out . now we 're running down the street after these doves i almost got hit by a bus . so how 's everything going over here ?
would you please ? .
uhh .
so i told him hit the road . i 'm going back with jack . '
i 'm sure you 'll have another fight george . hold that thought .

well this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm .
it can be very frustrating .
really ? what is it about ?
todd .
do n't worry tim . i did n't come by to yell at you i did n't come by for that at all . i just came by to pick up my label maker . i gave you a label maker and now i would like to have it back .

you know this guy jean paul jean paul i met him when i was working at pendant editing a book on running
he could n't tell an apple from an union and he 's your eye witness ?
uhh . what are you doing ?
cause then i could move in here .
george ?
jerry .
he reads everything you know nedo s very well read .
not so good .
well . uh . i do n't know about sick . i mean maybe it was somebody who did n't want to talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit chat ang was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling did n't want to speak to them ah .
we just tease some one til they develop an eating disorder . guy who ruined his life .
i ca n't . he 's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight . i do n't want to upset him . aw what the hell i 'll upset him .
what 's to discuss ?
ha . that 's preposterous .
because i got popcorn too and i ate that first .
it 's ok .
take a guess .
why did you get a maid ?
no .
why ? why did you get into a fist fight with the cop ? you were innocent .
adam you do n't become a man overnight . look at your father . it takes time . patience experience . uh several careers of varying success . and these are things i look for in a man .
what ?
no no no this is just cranberry juice .
i had to take it again .
well they 're perfectly edible .
are you sure ?
you know joel and i have an extra ticket to the giants game .
will you shut up ? i ca n't hear .
no no no no no . because i 'm picturing french connection' kind of thing . you know ? sort of a popeye doyle chase through the city .
that 's my coat . gimme that . where did you get that ?
why are you so concerned about this ?
i just finished working out are you busy ?
oh like any man would ever look at me come on i ? m going to get out of here .
mr . pitt i have something to tell you .
i had no idea you had this kind of money .
oh this is nuts . i ca n't get across anywhere .
what is wrong with this book ?
but i got my own note .
it was weird because george and i get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one on one .
oh yeah . yeah . i love nudist colonies . they help me unwind . aah .
okay so fine . go .
i did n't talk to anyone i was just walking by and i saw the sign and i thought george might get a kick out of it .
is that ?
she 's a physical therapist . she does n't want to have to deal with that outside of the office .
would n't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth ?
oh my god .
hey what do you think of this ?
i eh i got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer .
you know maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre .
oh .
uh that does n't make any sense . i am leaving .

communist ? do n't you think he probably would have told me ?
how much did he save ?
really ?
will you go ahead ? you need a haircut .
do n't get me wrong mr . lippman . i i 'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to lunge at me . huh . but the only reason you like me is because i 'm a shiksa .
he thinks that if you 're too funny he might not look so funny .
oh c 'mon newman .

hey .
i hope carlitto feels better . ben really wishes he couldo ve helped .
tell me if you think this is strange . there 's this guy who lives in my building who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend . he 's a uh teacher or something . anyway after we met whenever we 'd run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little . nothing much . little pleasantries . he 's a nice guy he 's got a family . then after a while i noticed there was not more stopping . just saying hello and continuing on our way . and then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition . so fine . i figure that 's where this relationship is finally going to settle polite nodding . then one day he does n't nod . like i do n't exist ? . he went from nods to nothing .
ok thanks so much . what are you all dressed up for ?
well i bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work . the way you worked on my filling you were so so gentle and so caring and so sensitive .
