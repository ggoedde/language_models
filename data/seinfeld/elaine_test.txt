she 's on the lease . george you have got to find another place for me .
it 's time you got outta here anyway .
well for me it 's a step up . it 's like moving from iceland to finland .
i was at bloomingdale 's waiting for the shower to heat up .
oh well come on . this is an apartment this is a home . this is a place to live . oooh a fireplace are you kidding me . does this work ?
they deliver it .

i ca n't believe i lost the deposit on that u haul . and i threw out my couch .
my roommate starts rehearsal tonight on carousel .
i do n't care i 'm not hungry .
oh what is this ?
no no no no no these are good . listen listen you ran out of underwear you ca n't leave the house .
hi .
huh thursday is no good because we 've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors .
they 're dying in the nets .
what do you think jerry ? you want to make twenty eight bucks ?
did n't work huh ?
almost as bad as losing out to a perfume .
did you get a haircut ?
and now there 's this intense animosity whenever we pass . i mean it 's like we really hate each other . it 's based on nothing .
really ?
hi .
yes . i spotted him getting his mail . and at first i was just going to walk on by but then i thought no no no . no . do not be afraid of this man . '
so i walked up behind him and i tapped him on the shoulder . and i said hi remember me ? and he furrows his brow as if he 's really trying to figure it out . so i said to him i said you little phony . you know exactly who i am . '
i did . i most certainly did . and he said he goes oh yeah . you 're jeanette 's friend . we did meet once . and i said well how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by ? '
and he says he says look i just did n't want to say hello anymore all right ? and i said fine . fine . i did n't want to say hello anymore either but just i wanted you to know that i 'm aware of it . '
this cantaloupe stinks .
no no . i 'm fine .
oh uh i do n't really eat dessert . i 'm dieting .
how long does a funeral take ?
oh yeah but i did n't say i hated anyone who had one .
george i met this woman . she is not traveling to any other dimensions .
phoenix ? what 's happening with his appartment ?
oh me too .
i have an idea . leave the winter clothing in the apartment and i 'll watch it for you and i 'll live there and i 'll make sure that nothing happens to it .
oh jeffrey .
you know the spirit world .
yeah but that does n't make up for killing her .
the back ? they never find anything in the back . if they had anything good in the back they 'd put it out in the front .
hey do n't forget sunday okay ? you and george are coming right ? hotel westbury eight o'clock .
what ? what you do n't want to go now ?

maybe coffee was coffee .
oh why ? i love it when guys call me the next day .
all she 'll think is that you like her .
well she wants you to like her .
do n't forget .
y'know my brother in law once left a message on this guy 's machine and he blurted out some business information he was n't supposed to and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars so he waited outside the guy 's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape .
yeah . this friend of a friend knows this banker guy he 's i do n't know NUM years unbelievably gorgeous of course he 's gay .
swan lake at the met .
really . why ?
well believe me this did n't happen overnight . robert 's not exactly a one woman man if you know what i mean . no sirree bob . sure i mean in a lot of ways he 's a typical guy he likes his sports but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet or the pleasure he gets in watching ms . liza minelli belt out a few choice numbers . it 's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is .
oh hi honey .
yeah i know .
why ? is it irrevocable ?
we 've got a good team .
yes i am .
melrose place ?

jerry . there is no confusing that move with any other move .
what else did you tell him . the two of you must have had quite a little chat .
because of all the pistons and the lube jobs ?
well wait wait a second .

yeah yeah hello .
yes . as a matter of fact . david putty wo n't do the move anymore .

i would but i have to pick up ed at the airport .
because if there 's even the slightest chance of any problem at all i do n't want to take it because if i do n't get this guy on a plane to seattle and out of my life i 'm going to kill him and everyone who tries to stop me .
i heard a little ping in the car last time . what was that ping ?
i spoke to a cab driver . for five bucks he turned me on to the rockaway boulevard shortcut .

it 's brown .
shoes ? shoes ? . shoes ? . shoes were n't invented till the fourth century . people walked around for thousands of years without them . i got this . let 's go .
i never new i could drive like that . i was going faster than i 've ever gone before and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion . i was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a gold metal run . i knew i was challenging the very laws of physics . at queens boulevard i took the shoulder . at jewel avenue i used the median . i had it . i was there and then i hit the van wyck . they say no one 's ever beaten the van wyck but gentlemen i tell you this i came as close as anyone ever has . and if it had n't been for that five car pile up on rockaway boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs .
yeah ?
i do n't like to talk during a massage .
oh okay go ahead .
really stupid .
so where do you get this note ?
what 's the name of this physical therapist ?
