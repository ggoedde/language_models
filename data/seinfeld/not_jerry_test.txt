thanks a lot . i 'll give it back to you in a week .
five thousand dollars ? she does n't have five thousand dollars .
of course you do .
yeah my wife could n't make it today . she 's got something with her mother who knows what 's going on with her . do n't let any one kid you it 's tough .

hi .
divorce is very difficult . especially on a kid .
of course i 'm the result of my parents having stayed together so you never know .

likewise .
what ?
well i 'm sorry timmy but i do n't dip that way .
well you see what happened was the doctor the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt suffered an untimely stroke and lost the use of his right hand so obviously i was unable to get the death certificate . however i do have this .

maybe karen is faking .
so uh you feel okay about that whole thing what we do in there you 're generally okay with everything in there ?
it 's jerry 's fault .

no julie julie do n't insult me . you know what difference does it make who pays for lunch . it 's totally meaningless .
did you happen to notice that julie handed the big salad to elaine ?
so did you enjoy your lunch ?
there is no problem . . . just a small miscommunication . whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad .
you know i think i could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house . it seems like fun to me . it does n't seem like a gender thing . i think i would like to play with dolls . what 's so terrible ?
a ha . we 're just friends .
. . . well it was a big salad . and what i would like to know is how does a person who has nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretenses ah ah ?
i 'm making it up .
she was n't flirting with you .
really ?
he probably does n't want to get chocolate on his fingers . that 's the way these society types eat their candy bars .
did you see the way she pointed at the check ? she gave me the finger .
jerry i 'm yankee management .

yeah is he still mad at you for crashing his thanksgiving party ?
heh heh .
so scott 's your roommate huh ?

oh that 's the worst part of it . he looks just like me .

she 's on the lease . george you have got to find another place for me .
it 's time you got outta here anyway .
well for me it 's a step up . it 's like moving from iceland to finland .
i was at bloomingdale 's waiting for the shower to heat up .
oh well come on . this is an apartment this is a home . this is a place to live . oooh a fireplace are you kidding me . does this work ?
they deliver it .

i do n't care i 'm not hungry .
oh what is this ?
no no no no no these are good . listen listen you ran out of underwear you ca n't leave the house .

huh thursday is no good because we 've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors .
they 're dying in the nets .
what do you think jerry ? you want to make twenty eight bucks ?
did n't work huh ?
almost as bad as losing out to a perfume .
did you get a haircut ?
and now there 's this intense animosity whenever we pass . i mean it 's like we really hate each other . it 's based on nothing .
really ?
hi .
yes . i spotted him getting his mail . and at first i was just going to walk on by but then i thought no no no . no . do not be afraid of this man . '
so i walked up behind him and i tapped him on the shoulder . and i said hi remember me ? and he furrows his brow as if he 's really trying to figure it out . so i said to him i said you little phony . you know exactly who i am . '
i did . i most certainly did . and he said he goes oh yeah . you 're jeanette 's friend . we did meet once . and i said well how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by ? '
and he says he says look i just did n't want to say hello anymore all right ? and i said fine . fine . i did n't want to say hello anymore either but just i wanted you to know that i 'm aware of it . '
this cantaloupe stinks .
no no . i 'm fine .
oh uh i do n't really eat dessert . i 'm dieting .
how long does a funeral take ?
oh yeah but i did n't say i hated anyone who had one .
george i met this woman . she is not traveling to any other dimensions .
phoenix ? what 's happening with his appartment ?
oh me too .
i have an idea . leave the winter clothing in the apartment and i 'll watch it for you and i 'll live there and i 'll make sure that nothing happens to it .
oh jeffrey .
you know the spirit world .
yeah but that does n't make up for killing her .
the back ? they never find anything in the back . if they had anything good in the back they 'd put it out in the front .
hey do n't forget sunday okay ? you and george are coming right ? hotel westbury eight o'clock .
what ? what you do n't want to go now ?
you have no idea .
yeah .
i did n't want to tell you this but usually he hates everyone .
yeah he like you though . said you reminded him of somebody he knew in korea .
maybe coffee was coffee .
oh why ? i love it when guys call me the next day .
all she 'll think is that you like her .
well she wants you to like her .
do n't forget .
y'know my brother in law once left a message on this guy 's machine and he blurted out some business information he was n't supposed to and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars so he waited outside the guy 's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape .
yeah . this friend of a friend knows this banker guy he 's i do n't know NUM years unbelievably gorgeous of course he 's gay .
swan lake at the met .
really . why ?
well believe me this did n't happen overnight . robert 's not exactly a one woman man if you know what i mean . no sirree bob . sure i mean in a lot of ways he 's a typical guy he likes his sports but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet or the pleasure he gets in watching ms . liza minelli belt out a few choice numbers . it 's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is .
oh hi honey .
yeah i know .
why ? is it irrevocable ?
we 've got a good team .
yes i am .
melrose place ?
i mean every time i mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation .
oh who do you think you are ? castanza ?
oh god this tastes terrible .

he went back .
yeah i guess i never really stood a chance .
okay .
i did n't ruin anything . he looked like an idiot . he did and it made him act like a jerk .
hey .
bye wendy . i 'm sorry .
what did you do that for ?
no . if you tell him to do it he 'll never do it .
yeah she 'll be here any second .

he thinks you 're mentally challenged . '

ya know its not fair people are seated first come first served it should be based on who 's hungriest . i feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody 's plate .
ok i do n't want to go over there and do it and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole like i did n't put mustard on it or something
i know this sounds crazy but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me NUM bucks if i stand here and eat one of your eggrolls .
i offered them NUM they had no idea
how do people fast ? did ghandi get this crazy ? i 'm going to walk around see what dishes look good .
i hate this place . i do n't know why we came here i 'm never coming back here again .
remember when you first went out to eat with your parents ? remember it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before and they put it in front of you and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure ? and now i just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough .

this is his home ?
he would n't give me his number because he does n't have a phone . he 's not married . he 's poor .

maybe all over your face .
hi i 'm miserable .

ohh right . cause if we 're dating what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers .
oh bravo .

no . she died .
what did he say ?
yes . NUM .

i would but i have to pick up ed at the airport .
because if there 's even the slightest chance of any problem at all i do n't want to take it because if i do n't get this guy on a plane to seattle and out of my life i 'm going to kill him and everyone who tries to stop me .
i heard a little ping in the car last time . what was that ping ?
i spoke to a cab driver . for five bucks he turned me on to the rockaway boulevard shortcut .

shoes ? shoes ? . shoes ? . shoes were n't invented till the fourth century . people walked around for thousands of years without them . i got this . let 's go .
i never new i could drive like that . i was going faster than i 've ever gone before and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion . i was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a gold metal run . i knew i was challenging the very laws of physics . at queens boulevard i took the shoulder . at jewel avenue i used the median . i had it . i was there and then i hit the van wyck . they say no one 's ever beaten the van wyck but gentlemen i tell you this i came as close as anyone ever has . and if it had n't been for that five car pile up on rockaway boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs .
yeah ?
i do n't like to talk during a massage .
oh okay go ahead .
really stupid .
so where do you get this note ?
what 's the name of this physical therapist ?
