well i was buttering myself up for a nice shave
wh where do you get'em ? '
good to see you again . font
you see i disagree . i 'd rather be dating the blind . you know you could let the house go . you could let yourself go . a good looking blind woman does n't even know you 're not good enough for her .
i was trying to loosen em up a little bit .
so you 're jason hanke 's supervisor ?
hi elaine
no . i 'm not going to do that . that 's one step away from personal ads . and prostitutes . no . no i am not going down that road . what does she look like ?
why are two pretending to be laughing ?
and i can make a left turn from the right lane too .
dee deena .

you know that that thing about her being too good for him . i mean i was just being folksy . they could tell i was just being folksy ?
uh i 'm just selling some of dado s things that 's what he would have wanted .
ya and also i 'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me . you know they got nothing to lose what do they care ?
elaine can i just explain something to you very privately here ? susan and i have been together many many times now and just between you and me there 's really no big surprises here so make up sex is all that i have left .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
kramer do you know what those guys are going to do to me ? .
but i i i
you might want to try it makes the movie more enjoyable that 's all .
hey hey hey . what 's going on here ? you did n't agree to anything did ya ?
are you sure ?
so i 'm dressing and she 's staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events . i do n't know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all i do n't have the time to say it . the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman and i 'm very sorry i just saw the bat signal . it took me NUM days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again . now she 's waiting for me to call her and she 's
what about your stuff ?

you think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to paris with them ? it turns out that the kido s father lives in paris . is that a coincidence ? eh you know alec wants me to take him over there so i figure as long as they 're going
not a plane crash . is it a plane crash ?
how can you just get it ?
oh you 're dead .
oh no i ca n't do it . i i 'm not good at these things i get flustered . once i tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby i almost got arrested .
oh .
what if she discusses it with jane ?
that 's right no discount .
this guy stinks .
so what ? so what if i do ?
i have to get in touch with tatiana . and look at his little outfit . it 's all so coordinated the way his socks matching to his shirt . i really hate this guy .
you should have lied .
NUM people ? . that 's it ? . i thought it was like a thousand .
oh you mean face down on her chest .
hey hey hey we 're in a rush here .
yeah . we should do this again .
yeah but nothing happens on the show . you see it 's just like life . you know you eat you go shopping you read you eat you read you go shopping .
i love the mirror in that bathroom . i do n't know what in the hell it is . i look terrific in that mirror . i do n't know if it 's the tile or the lighting i feel like robert wagner .
my credit card ?

are are you sure this is decaf ? where 's the orange indicator ?
jerry it 's me george do n't worry i 'll return it tomorrow no problem .
ok look the gum is n't cutting it for me . we need to be about something else anything please .
okay . hey you know what maybe i should give it to my therapist to read . she 's smart i trust her .
i love when they touch your arm . i ca n't get enough of that . why is that ?
it 's george .
do n't look around . do n't look around . that 's what he wants .
he he he he
not even an apple .
it 's a performance jerry . like what you do .
what 's so hard about that ? how am i supposed to get it in there ? i ca n't just walk in with it . i have to get the rosses out of the apartment .
well i think you should drop him down to step two .
drakes ?
it 's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring .
well actually i thought it up on the way over here .
hide hide under the desk .
good thing i asked
when i asked him if it was cancer he did n't give me a get outta here . that 's what i wanted to hear cancer ? get outta here ? '
i find it disorienting . who buys an umbrella anyway ? y you get em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans .
why do n't you call her agency . maybe she 's been out of town and she did n't get the calls .
ang wait 'll you see the dress that she 's got . it 's backless . uh ? . i 'm finally going to make a great entrance .
hawaii ?
we 'll ask him . my dear fellow where are you dropping us ?
above the rim .
who the croat ?
he asked me to keep it a secret .
do you want us to go with you ?
really .
alright so i have n't put anything in it since sixth grade i completely forgot about it . the state controller 's office tracks me down . the interest has accumulated to NUM NUM dollars . NUM NUM dollars . they 're sending me a cheque .
what is holland ?
doing quite well thank you . yesterday i had a soft boiled egg and a quickie . you know what ? if i could add tv to the equation that would really be the ultimate .
yes .
you got it .
he 's a jerk .
ah alright before that i was in real estate . i quit because the boss would n't let me use his private bathroom . that was it .
the thing that bothers me the most is the lying .
a guy ?
it 's only four
huh . you must think i 'm pretty stupid . that was no NUM avenue bar . i can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip . now that that that is a cookie and we all know that twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch .
you mean a blessing in disguise ?
i got your calzones mr . steinbrenner .
so in order to use these i got to spend like fifteen hundred bucks . this is a bill for fifteen hundred dollars . plus she 'd ask about the sleeping arrangements that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing .
look at where we are . he 's not stopping . he just keeps going and going and going . we 're not in the first row ?
at the funeral give or take . you know deep down i always kinda felt that they blamed me for susan 's death .
yeah yeah . you must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too .
do oh oh oh the judge . i hate this guy .
i think i 'd be good at that . i talk to people all the time . someone even told me once they thought i 'd be a good talk show host .
excuse me ?
yeah .
here 's the tv . i know you wanted to watch the super bowl . do you at least have some towels we could sit on ? it 's like a four hour game .
we do ?
we are really late now . we 're in big trouble . big trouble .

you know what i never understood ? why did they change the siren noise ? when i was a kid it was always waaaa waaaa' you know now it woo woo woo woo woo . why did they do that did they do some research ? did they find that woo woo was more effective than waa ?
you are a genius it 's as simple as that .
really ?
well you know it 's really very funny because you know what we got here really ? we really really just have a terrible misunderstanding . you see when i passed on the deal i thought that 's what jerry wanted me to say . y'know i i misinterpreted .

i uh just think it 's a little unusual . two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty .
so i started to walk into the water . i wo n't lie to you boys i was terrified . but i pressed on and as i made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me . i i do n't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but i tell you jerry at that moment i was a marine biologist .

apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a toxic .
all right . so let me ask you a question . who was the man in the cape ?
yeah thank you .
where ?
what is that the one your parents gave you ?
oh my god .
looks like veal .
but i mean look at him . he 's got to be on his feet like that all day ? that 's brutal . i think i 'm going to say something to your uncle .
well it 's getting dark .
i told you i told you . ha ha ha . ooh ooh .
i just got fired .
uh yeah . hang on . just yeah .
why do n't you just commit yourself already ?
i mean she 's beautiful right ? she 's just my type . the dark hair the full lips .
i think i 'm getting tired of it . i mean is that all it does ? hello ? la la la ?
pst . wilkinson 's got a bite on a new one . petramco corp . out of uh springfield . i think . they 're about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher .
listen you go over to the ticket counter i 'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of time magazine . there 's supposed to ba blurb about jerry in it and i think he mentioned my name .

well i 've given this a lot of thought and i 've got to say
you could pet them . they come right out of the water onto the sidewalks .
yes hello . party 's over .
hey hay . lloyd . hey . my friend jerry eh .
yup .
people who do that should be arrested .
i noticed you eh chose the eh clowns with balloons check design .

you do n't know ?
jerry could you excuse us for a few minutes please ?
ade i have to tell you i i have never met anybody so efficient .

well danielle we should get going . i got a key made for you .
my cousin worked for bouchardo s . they used to use the bouilla base for a toilet .
i 'll have the tuna .
nucleosis .
now see here doctor .
i am never saying i love you again unless they say it first .
seemingly . seemingly to the untrained eye i can fully understand how you got that impression . what looked like pushing what looked like knocking down was a safety precaution . in a fire you stay close to the ground am i right ? and when i ran out that door i was not leaving anyone behind . oh quite the contrary . i risked my life making sure that exit was clear . any other questions ?
they say this guy 's the best .
not really . your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch .
alright but no later because my parents are coming back .
medium turkey chili .
well they hurt him bad . really hurt his feelings . it 's a long story . i i do n't like to talk about it but i swore then that i would never work for big broker houses . see all they care about is money . i 'm about more than money i 'm about people always gone my own way and i 've never looked back .
ava was one of the reasons i used to like going to work she was a friend . now we sleep together and suddenly i do n't know how to talk to her . every time i go to the bathroom i pass her desk . i have to plan little patter . i spend half my day writing . then afterwards i sit in my office and analyze how it went . if it was a good conversation i do n't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day . i see her laughing and talking with other people they 're all so loose and relaxed i think that used to be me . i want to go back there again . '
so anyway if you think about it manure is not really that bad a word . i mean it 's newer' which is good and a ma in front of it which is also good . ma newer right ?

good thinking .
well i wish i could say the same but i must say with all due respect i find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization . in the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of new york a good deal of distress as we have watched you take our beloved yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock all for the glorification of your massive ego .
what ?
yeah i better grab some too .
i have to talk to elaine . this cleaing lady is turning the screws on me . she 's pushing for this whole relationship thing . she keeps calling me threatening to go to the boss with this thing i could lose my job i got to do something to keep her quiet .
i just talked to mr . kruger he 'll be down in a minute . he wanted me to take a photograph for the record .
ha ha ha ha oh all right go ahead deride deride if you must . but let me tell you something with my personality and this set of hair you know what i am now ? i am in the game . i no longer defer to the coifed . i 'm a player .
are you kidding ? i lie every second of the day . my whole life is a sham .
shut up ?
and she 'll still see it you 're not stopping her from seeing it .
this is a crude mock up of the conference room . NUM scale .
newww tuxedo . for the pinstripe ball . steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at tavern on the green heh .

oh you want to taste mine .
i mean we can put a man on the moon but we 're still basically very stupid . the guy who 's car this is ? he could be one of the guys that built the rocket . you see what i 'm saying ?
when you 're playing the piano do you think about me ?
well i think this is it .
yeah yeah .
NUM NUM p . m . do you need any money ?
did you tell her anything ?
no lindsay it was not in the garbage . it was above the garbage . hovering . like an angel . of course i know your aunt bit it . i kissed her goodbye . listen can i tell you something else ? in my family we used to eat out of the garbage all the time . it was no big thing . that 's right . oh okay . buh bye . i 'm back in she gave me a second chance .
i say fourteen o nine .
no no no . nothing happens .
so i 've got ice cream all over my face . there were no napkins there . whoever it was that 's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship .
maybe i 'll get her some jewelry .
no i uh i use it .
you know what this means ? i ca n't see her anymore either .
oh no . no stories .

i will never understand the bathrooms in this country . why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor ?

well actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment . have you ever seen elaine dance ?
come on . come check out my new place . it 'll take you two minutes .
listen buck i uh obviously i do n't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale but uh i 've been talking to some of the guys and some of them i do n't want to mention any names but some of them they 're not too happy with the polyester uniforms .

i 'm just going to go to the bathroom .
so they knew ? those liars .
pull it up a little bit .
food was good .

what about sharon besser ?
yeah that 's right . it 's working .
yada .
dollar eighty nine . why is this a dollar eighty nine ? why is there no haggling in this country ? font
i mean how funny is this ?
so i tell alec that i have to go to paris for an undetermined amount of time . then all i have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from paris .
i ca n't believe what 's happening here . she has n't taken her hands off me all night . she was always friendly around the office but that was it .

it 's not the money .
come on . we got all day tomorrow to come up with a story .

i know . this was the only woman i never lied to . well that 's not entirely true .
yeah you 're just so hip .
ha harrr . '
what are we going to do ? how are we going to get out of here ?
yeah like i 'm going to risk my job with the new york yankees to make a few extra bucks .
i 'm not really sure i
keith called you ?
you said the guy gave you an open lipped kiss .
well that 's the gist of it .
have you ever had their egg salad ?
five thousand ten . ten thousand . five thousand .
and this is kramer .
sorry you do n't know what 's going on out there . who 's he ?
heh haa . and that 's no good . i 've tried it straight jerry . we 've all seen the results . for me sick is the only way to go .
we could build a cabin like that .
it 's baffling is n't it ?
oh yes . i i 'm your baby bluey .
yodel lay hee hoo
the woman we bought the wheelchair for ?
perhaps . i walk in everything is organized messages appointments . and i ca n't tell you how proud i am of myself for going with ade .
yeah right .
i got to call her . should i call her ?
you really think so ?
oh so now i have to buy this whole chair by myself ?
like this .
yeah the neck hole thing and i would appreciate it if you would say you 're sorry .
yes i look forward to many years of looking at the triangles . well i 'll ah i 'll wait for you outside .
but after that we really talked did n't we ?
well it 's this little place with this little bathroom . it 's like right there you know it 's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove . you understand ? there 's no buffer zone . so we start to fool around and it 's the first time and it 's early in the going . and i begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm . so i know i 'm going to have to stop . and as this is happening i 'm thinking even if i can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force i know that that bathroom is not going to provide me with the privacy that i know i 'm going to need
i think he was impressed .
so now the father is screaming at me he 's demanding that i pay for the boom box . finally i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there .
well thank you for your support .
hurry up .
it 's ok .
well you know if you were sitting right next to her you 'd have to console her no matter what .
wait a minute wait a minute do you think i ? m comfortable here . i ca n't change i ? ve got no clothes here . you 've got to go like that i can ? t go like this alone .
do we have to ?
wax museum .

all i know is i 've been going to doctors all my life . what has it gotten me ? i 'm thirty three years old . i have n't outgrown the problems of puberty i 'm already facing the problems of old age . i completely skipped healthy adulthood . i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever . you could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm . i 've never had a normal medium orgasm .
hunh you know it 's the damnedest thing . i went out the window again to to get a cup of coffee

no i have n't spoken to her all day uh yeah right um as a matter of fact um she was here and she uh left a note but i was n't here but i have the note uh right here .
what ? that ? s why i came all the way over here .
i think they went out to dinner .
oh how would he know . he blacked out . he fainted .
well he said he 'd drive me here right after . so i am sitting in his car twenty minutes . he does n't come down . i am freezing . then a cop comes by tells me to get out of the car . he 's a city marshal . he 's towing the car away . kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets . he was going to tow it with me in the car . so they tow the car . now i am standing outside and i am freezing but i cannot leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car . so finally he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves . he said he was getting special instructions that each dove has a different diet so we 're wandering around trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out . now we 're running down the street after these doves i almost got hit by a bus . so how 's everything going over here ?
would you please ? .
uhh .
so i told him hit the road . i 'm going back with jack . '
i 'm sure you 'll have another fight george . hold that thought .

well this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm .
it can be very frustrating .
really ? what is it about ?
todd .
do n't worry tim . i did n't come by to yell at you i did n't come by for that at all . i just came by to pick up my label maker . i gave you a label maker and now i would like to have it back .

you know this guy jean paul jean paul i met him when i was working at pendant editing a book on running
he could n't tell an apple from an union and he 's your eye witness ?
uhh . what are you doing ?
cause then i could move in here .
george ?
jerry .
he reads everything you know nedo s very well read .
not so good .
well . uh . i do n't know about sick . i mean maybe it was somebody who did n't want to talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit chat ang was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling did n't want to speak to them ah .
we just tease some one til they develop an eating disorder . guy who ruined his life .
i ca n't . he 's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight . i do n't want to upset him . aw what the hell i 'll upset him .
what 's to discuss ?
ha . that 's preposterous .
because i got popcorn too and i ate that first .
it 's ok .
take a guess .
why did you get a maid ?
no .
why ? why did you get into a fist fight with the cop ? you were innocent .
adam you do n't become a man overnight . look at your father . it takes time . patience experience . uh several careers of varying success . and these are things i look for in a man .
what ?
no no no this is just cranberry juice .
i had to take it again .
well they 're perfectly edible .
are you sure ?
you know joel and i have an extra ticket to the giants game .
will you shut up ? i ca n't hear .
no no no no no . because i 'm picturing french connection' kind of thing . you know ? sort of a popeye doyle chase through the city .
that 's my coat . gimme that . where did you get that ?
why are you so concerned about this ?
i just finished working out are you busy ?
oh like any man would ever look at me come on i ? m going to get out of here .
mr . pitt i have something to tell you .
i had no idea you had this kind of money .
oh this is nuts . i ca n't get across anywhere .
what is wrong with this book ?
but i got my own note .
it was weird because george and i get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one on one .
oh yeah . yeah . i love nudist colonies . they help me unwind . aah .
okay so fine . go .
i did n't talk to anyone i was just walking by and i saw the sign and i thought george might get a kick out of it .
is that ?
she 's a physical therapist . she does n't want to have to deal with that outside of the office .
would n't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth ?
oh my god .
hey what do you think of this ?
i eh i got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer .
you know maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre .
oh .
uh that does n't make any sense . i am leaving .

he tells him which soap to use .
well i do n't know . i may never marry . it might be the closest i get .
come on tell me what happened .
cos i 'm not in the mood .
communist ? do n't you think he probably would have told me ?
how much did he save ?
really ?
will you go ahead ? you need a haircut .
do n't get me wrong mr . lippman . i i 'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to lunge at me . huh . but the only reason you like me is because i 'm a shiksa .
he thinks that if you 're too funny he might not look so funny .
oh c 'mon newman .
of course you do it 's an engagement party .
hmm where is jerry sitting ? he 's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend i 'm dying to see what she looks like

hey .
i hope carlitto feels better . ben really wishes he couldo ve helped .
tell me if you think this is strange . there 's this guy who lives in my building who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend . he 's a uh teacher or something . anyway after we met whenever we 'd run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little . nothing much . little pleasantries . he 's a nice guy he 's got a family . then after a while i noticed there was not more stopping . just saying hello and continuing on our way . and then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition . so fine . i figure that 's where this relationship is finally going to settle polite nodding . then one day he does n't nod . like i do n't exist ? . he went from nods to nothing .
ok thanks so much . what are you all dressed up for ?
well i bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work . the way you worked on my filling you were so so gentle and so caring and so sensitive .
