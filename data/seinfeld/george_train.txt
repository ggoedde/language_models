well i was buttering myself up for a nice shave
wh where do you get'em ? '
good to see you again . font
you see i disagree . i 'd rather be dating the blind . you know you could let the house go . you could let yourself go . a good looking blind woman does n't even know you 're not good enough for her .
i was trying to loosen em up a little bit .
so you 're jason hanke 's supervisor ?
hi elaine
no . i 'm not going to do that . that 's one step away from personal ads . and prostitutes . no . no i am not going down that road . what does she look like ?
why are two pretending to be laughing ?
and i can make a left turn from the right lane too .
dee deena .

you know that that thing about her being too good for him . i mean i was just being folksy . they could tell i was just being folksy ?
uh i 'm just selling some of dado s things that 's what he would have wanted .
ya and also i 'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me . you know they got nothing to lose what do they care ?
elaine can i just explain something to you very privately here ? susan and i have been together many many times now and just between you and me there 's really no big surprises here so make up sex is all that i have left .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
kramer do you know what those guys are going to do to me ? .
but i i i
you might want to try it makes the movie more enjoyable that 's all .
hey hey hey . what 's going on here ? you did n't agree to anything did ya ?
are you sure ?
so i 'm dressing and she 's staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events . i do n't know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all i do n't have the time to say it . the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman and i 'm very sorry i just saw the bat signal . it took me NUM days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again . now she 's waiting for me to call her and she 's
what about your stuff ?

you think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to paris with them ? it turns out that the kido s father lives in paris . is that a coincidence ? eh you know alec wants me to take him over there so i figure as long as they 're going
not a plane crash . is it a plane crash ?
how can you just get it ?
oh you 're dead .
oh no i ca n't do it . i i 'm not good at these things i get flustered . once i tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby i almost got arrested .
oh .
what if she discusses it with jane ?
that 's right no discount .
this guy stinks .
so what ? so what if i do ?
i have to get in touch with tatiana . and look at his little outfit . it 's all so coordinated the way his socks matching to his shirt . i really hate this guy .
you should have lied .
NUM people ? . that 's it ? . i thought it was like a thousand .
oh you mean face down on her chest .
hey hey hey we 're in a rush here .
yeah . we should do this again .
yeah but nothing happens on the show . you see it 's just like life . you know you eat you go shopping you read you eat you read you go shopping .
i love the mirror in that bathroom . i do n't know what in the hell it is . i look terrific in that mirror . i do n't know if it 's the tile or the lighting i feel like robert wagner .
my credit card ?

are are you sure this is decaf ? where 's the orange indicator ?
jerry it 's me george do n't worry i 'll return it tomorrow no problem .
ok look the gum is n't cutting it for me . we need to be about something else anything please .
okay . hey you know what maybe i should give it to my therapist to read . she 's smart i trust her .
i love when they touch your arm . i ca n't get enough of that . why is that ?
it 's george .
do n't look around . do n't look around . that 's what he wants .
he he he he
not even an apple .
it 's a performance jerry . like what you do .
what 's so hard about that ? how am i supposed to get it in there ? i ca n't just walk in with it . i have to get the rosses out of the apartment .
well i think you should drop him down to step two .
drakes ?
it 's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring .
well actually i thought it up on the way over here .
hide hide under the desk .
good thing i asked
when i asked him if it was cancer he did n't give me a get outta here . that 's what i wanted to hear cancer ? get outta here ? '
i find it disorienting . who buys an umbrella anyway ? y you get em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans .
why do n't you call her agency . maybe she 's been out of town and she did n't get the calls .
ang wait 'll you see the dress that she 's got . it 's backless . uh ? . i 'm finally going to make a great entrance .
hawaii ?
we 'll ask him . my dear fellow where are you dropping us ?
above the rim .
who the croat ?
he asked me to keep it a secret .
do you want us to go with you ?
really .
alright so i have n't put anything in it since sixth grade i completely forgot about it . the state controller 's office tracks me down . the interest has accumulated to NUM NUM dollars . NUM NUM dollars . they 're sending me a cheque .
what is holland ?
doing quite well thank you . yesterday i had a soft boiled egg and a quickie . you know what ? if i could add tv to the equation that would really be the ultimate .
yes .
you got it .
he 's a jerk .
ah alright before that i was in real estate . i quit because the boss would n't let me use his private bathroom . that was it .
the thing that bothers me the most is the lying .
a guy ?
it 's only four
huh . you must think i 'm pretty stupid . that was no NUM avenue bar . i can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip . now that that that is a cookie and we all know that twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch .
you mean a blessing in disguise ?
i got your calzones mr . steinbrenner .
so in order to use these i got to spend like fifteen hundred bucks . this is a bill for fifteen hundred dollars . plus she 'd ask about the sleeping arrangements that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing .
look at where we are . he 's not stopping . he just keeps going and going and going . we 're not in the first row ?
at the funeral give or take . you know deep down i always kinda felt that they blamed me for susan 's death .
yeah yeah . you must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too .
do oh oh oh the judge . i hate this guy .
i think i 'd be good at that . i talk to people all the time . someone even told me once they thought i 'd be a good talk show host .
excuse me ?
yeah .
here 's the tv . i know you wanted to watch the super bowl . do you at least have some towels we could sit on ? it 's like a four hour game .
we do ?
we are really late now . we 're in big trouble . big trouble .

you know what i never understood ? why did they change the siren noise ? when i was a kid it was always waaaa waaaa' you know now it woo woo woo woo woo . why did they do that did they do some research ? did they find that woo woo was more effective than waa ?
you are a genius it 's as simple as that .
really ?
well you know it 's really very funny because you know what we got here really ? we really really just have a terrible misunderstanding . you see when i passed on the deal i thought that 's what jerry wanted me to say . y'know i i misinterpreted .

i uh just think it 's a little unusual . two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty .
so i started to walk into the water . i wo n't lie to you boys i was terrified . but i pressed on and as i made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me . i i do n't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but i tell you jerry at that moment i was a marine biologist .

apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a toxic .
all right . so let me ask you a question . who was the man in the cape ?
yeah thank you .
where ?
what is that the one your parents gave you ?
oh my god .
looks like veal .
but i mean look at him . he 's got to be on his feet like that all day ? that 's brutal . i think i 'm going to say something to your uncle .
well it 's getting dark .
i told you i told you . ha ha ha . ooh ooh .
i just got fired .
uh yeah . hang on . just yeah .
why do n't you just commit yourself already ?
i mean she 's beautiful right ? she 's just my type . the dark hair the full lips .
i think i 'm getting tired of it . i mean is that all it does ? hello ? la la la ?
pst . wilkinson 's got a bite on a new one . petramco corp . out of uh springfield . i think . they 're about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher .
listen you go over to the ticket counter i 'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of time magazine . there 's supposed to ba blurb about jerry in it and i think he mentioned my name .

well i 've given this a lot of thought and i 've got to say
you could pet them . they come right out of the water onto the sidewalks .
yes hello . party 's over .
hey hay . lloyd . hey . my friend jerry eh .
yup .
people who do that should be arrested .
i noticed you eh chose the eh clowns with balloons check design .

you do n't know ?
jerry could you excuse us for a few minutes please ?
ade i have to tell you i i have never met anybody so efficient .

well danielle we should get going . i got a key made for you .
my cousin worked for bouchardo s . they used to use the bouilla base for a toilet .
i 'll have the tuna .
nucleosis .
now see here doctor .
i am never saying i love you again unless they say it first .
seemingly . seemingly to the untrained eye i can fully understand how you got that impression . what looked like pushing what looked like knocking down was a safety precaution . in a fire you stay close to the ground am i right ? and when i ran out that door i was not leaving anyone behind . oh quite the contrary . i risked my life making sure that exit was clear . any other questions ?
they say this guy 's the best .
not really . your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch .
alright but no later because my parents are coming back .
medium turkey chili .
well they hurt him bad . really hurt his feelings . it 's a long story . i i do n't like to talk about it but i swore then that i would never work for big broker houses . see all they care about is money . i 'm about more than money i 'm about people always gone my own way and i 've never looked back .
ava was one of the reasons i used to like going to work she was a friend . now we sleep together and suddenly i do n't know how to talk to her . every time i go to the bathroom i pass her desk . i have to plan little patter . i spend half my day writing . then afterwards i sit in my office and analyze how it went . if it was a good conversation i do n't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day . i see her laughing and talking with other people they 're all so loose and relaxed i think that used to be me . i want to go back there again . '
so anyway if you think about it manure is not really that bad a word . i mean it 's newer' which is good and a ma in front of it which is also good . ma newer right ?

good thinking .
well i wish i could say the same but i must say with all due respect i find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization . in the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of new york a good deal of distress as we have watched you take our beloved yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock all for the glorification of your massive ego .
what ?
yeah i better grab some too .
i have to talk to elaine . this cleaing lady is turning the screws on me . she 's pushing for this whole relationship thing . she keeps calling me threatening to go to the boss with this thing i could lose my job i got to do something to keep her quiet .
i just talked to mr . kruger he 'll be down in a minute . he wanted me to take a photograph for the record .
ha ha ha ha oh all right go ahead deride deride if you must . but let me tell you something with my personality and this set of hair you know what i am now ? i am in the game . i no longer defer to the coifed . i 'm a player .
are you kidding ? i lie every second of the day . my whole life is a sham .
shut up ?
and she 'll still see it you 're not stopping her from seeing it .
this is a crude mock up of the conference room . NUM scale .
newww tuxedo . for the pinstripe ball . steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at tavern on the green heh .

oh you want to taste mine .
i mean we can put a man on the moon but we 're still basically very stupid . the guy who 's car this is ? he could be one of the guys that built the rocket . you see what i 'm saying ?
when you 're playing the piano do you think about me ?
well i think this is it .
yeah yeah .
NUM NUM p . m . do you need any money ?
did you tell her anything ?
no lindsay it was not in the garbage . it was above the garbage . hovering . like an angel . of course i know your aunt bit it . i kissed her goodbye . listen can i tell you something else ? in my family we used to eat out of the garbage all the time . it was no big thing . that 's right . oh okay . buh bye . i 'm back in she gave me a second chance .
i say fourteen o nine .
no no no . nothing happens .
so i 've got ice cream all over my face . there were no napkins there . whoever it was that 's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship .
maybe i 'll get her some jewelry .
no i uh i use it .
you know what this means ? i ca n't see her anymore either .
oh no . no stories .

i will never understand the bathrooms in this country . why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor ?

well actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment . have you ever seen elaine dance ?
come on . come check out my new place . it 'll take you two minutes .
listen buck i uh obviously i do n't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale but uh i 've been talking to some of the guys and some of them i do n't want to mention any names but some of them they 're not too happy with the polyester uniforms .

i 'm just going to go to the bathroom .
so they knew ? those liars .
pull it up a little bit .
food was good .

what about sharon besser ?
yeah that 's right . it 's working .
yada .
dollar eighty nine . why is this a dollar eighty nine ? why is there no haggling in this country ? font
i mean how funny is this ?
so i tell alec that i have to go to paris for an undetermined amount of time . then all i have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from paris .
i ca n't believe what 's happening here . she has n't taken her hands off me all night . she was always friendly around the office but that was it .

it 's not the money .
come on . we got all day tomorrow to come up with a story .

i know . this was the only woman i never lied to . well that 's not entirely true .
yeah you 're just so hip .
ha harrr . '
what are we going to do ? how are we going to get out of here ?
yeah like i 'm going to risk my job with the new york yankees to make a few extra bucks .
i 'm not really sure i
keith called you ?
you said the guy gave you an open lipped kiss .
well that 's the gist of it .
have you ever had their egg salad ?
five thousand ten . ten thousand . five thousand .
and this is kramer .
sorry you do n't know what 's going on out there . who 's he ?
heh haa . and that 's no good . i 've tried it straight jerry . we 've all seen the results . for me sick is the only way to go .
we could build a cabin like that .
it 's baffling is n't it ?
oh yes . i i 'm your baby bluey .
yodel lay hee hoo
the woman we bought the wheelchair for ?
perhaps . i walk in everything is organized messages appointments . and i ca n't tell you how proud i am of myself for going with ade .
yeah right .
i got to call her . should i call her ?
you really think so ?
oh so now i have to buy this whole chair by myself ?
like this .
yeah the neck hole thing and i would appreciate it if you would say you 're sorry .
yes i look forward to many years of looking at the triangles . well i 'll ah i 'll wait for you outside .
but after that we really talked did n't we ?
well it 's this little place with this little bathroom . it 's like right there you know it 's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove . you understand ? there 's no buffer zone . so we start to fool around and it 's the first time and it 's early in the going . and i begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm . so i know i 'm going to have to stop . and as this is happening i 'm thinking even if i can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force i know that that bathroom is not going to provide me with the privacy that i know i 'm going to need
i think he was impressed .
so now the father is screaming at me he 's demanding that i pay for the boom box . finally i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there .
well thank you for your support .
hurry up .
it 's ok .
well you know if you were sitting right next to her you 'd have to console her no matter what .
wait a minute wait a minute do you think i ? m comfortable here . i ca n't change i ? ve got no clothes here . you 've got to go like that i can ? t go like this alone .
do we have to ?
wax museum .

all i know is i 've been going to doctors all my life . what has it gotten me ? i 'm thirty three years old . i have n't outgrown the problems of puberty i 'm already facing the problems of old age . i completely skipped healthy adulthood . i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever . you could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm . i 've never had a normal medium orgasm .
hunh you know it 's the damnedest thing . i went out the window again to to get a cup of coffee
