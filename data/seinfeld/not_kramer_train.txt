i did n't call her till today .
what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm dylan murphy .
i do n't know .
a month and a half we had . we did nothing . i ca n't believe we put it off until today and then we could n't do anything because elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin crosses against a light and knocks over a chinese delivery boy . now we 're going to make fools of ourselves we got nothing . you 're not even in show business . i got to reputation . you drag me into the sewer with you . i 've been on tv buddy boy . you know how fast word spreads in show business ? it 's like that like that . one bad impression you 're outta the business .
no no no . no dinner .
there 's nothing wrong with him . i saw the doctor . he 's fine .
do n't you think i know the difference between a pick and a scratch ?
so you 're sure you 're not still angry about last night ?
all right now you call it in the air .
well how are you going
oh you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend .
you know i do n't get that whole suicide machine . there 's no tall buildings where these people live ? they ca n't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person ?

anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway . i mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant .
for crying out loud he 's superman . fulton ? fulton ?
this may be the most perfect jacket i have ever put on .
but you said it can be very serious .
hard to believe .
no thanks just the check .

crazy joe divola

so biff wants to be a buff ? well sleeping less than NUM hours a day would be a start .

he just went in . you know i think he was wearing my hounds tooth jacket .
i think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now .
so this da vinci sleep is working out ?
it was sold out .
the doorman . i do n't want to play anymore of his mindgames . what time does he get off ?
elaine look . i drew this triangle free hand . it 's a doodle . it 's perfect .
oh so hopelessness is the key .
when all the while the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us .
mr . fields i 'm here to spend some time with you .
you know i do n't get it . not allowed to ask a chinese person where the chinese restaurant is . i mean are n't we all getting a little too sensitive ? i mean someone asks me which way is israel i do n't fly off the handle .
all right all right . all right that 's enough . let 's get back to my deal . that undercoating that 's a rip off is n't it david ?
i prefer clockwise but it 's not written in stone .
i think so . i mean he 's acting really weird lately he 's different .
okay fifteen minutes . i guarantee you fifteen minutes i can make it happen .
easy big fella .
right quiet dignity . as opposed to say this ?
the engine 's made by mcdonnell douglas .

green suit power ring .
ah will you stop it already ?
alright do n't wander too far i 'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes .

hmm hmm .
ohh
oh .
no big surprises .
you collect tv guide ?
hi ralph .
there should be more people like us .
that whole thing the whole production it was all an act ?
you know i really i 've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they 're just always your friends and you have to accept it . you see them you do n't really want to see them . you do n't call them they call you . you do n't call back they call again . the only way to get through talking with people that you do n't really have anything in common with is to pretend you 're hosting your own little talk show . this is what i do . you pretend there 's a little desk around you . the only problem with this is there 's no way you can say hey it 's been great having you on the show . we 're out of time . '
what do you mean you snubbed her ?
uh we 'll go to NUMrd avenue . so can you come with us for lunch to the soup place ?

oh he ran to say something to david letterman .
i do n't know some mints or tictacs .
maybe it 'll be fun having a pet .
well it 's something to consider .
can i can i at least just talk to her so i can apologize ? forget it . i ca n't believe this i make one innocent comment about some lunatic in pennsylvania and i 'm cut off . this woman is insane . what 's with you ?
i 've been thinking about her i just cashed some of her checks .

i do n't believe it . font

i mean she called me . i have n't called her . she started it .
oh yeah right .
that 's not what i do .
this is a nightmare .
oh i 'm so sorry . i got stuck out of town . i missed our whole time together .
what ? the physical therapist ? why ?
good to meet you .
elaine what do you think ?

i can ?
do n't be so sure . look at george he 's on his ninth date with betsy he still has n't gotten anywhere with her .

thanks again .
heeeeyyyyyyyy
we 're going . that 's next wednesday .
there was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing just a bra . i ca n't get that image out of my mind .
yeah .
ohh boy . well i got to meet elaine and run some errands . so
pottery barn ?
i could n't believe it . uh i mean i thought i was entering a magical world of sensual delights but it was just so ordinary . i mean there was nothing gymnastic about it .
wait a second . maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out
i have to say those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me .
i hate the drake . maybe the whole thing was a scam . anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all . maybe they 're on their way to chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again .
you are the queen of confrontation . you 're my new hero . in fact you 've inspired me . i 'm going to call george about something right now .
that 's very nice i guess .
how you doing ?
i 'm just pretending i 'm married to get a discount on dry cleaning .
ah just a couple of gals out on the town shopping and gabbing .
and what 's with that hairdo by the way ?
well at least have some reaction to it .
nofont
yeah .
for example now i call you whenever i 'm inclined and vice versa .
it was a bad jig to begin with we never should have started this jig .
uh again ? i 'll be right there .
well i think by sleeping with her i may have sent her the wrong message .
you 've really gone mental .
you have them sleeping in drawers ? .
what is that smell ?
that 's surprising his fruit is usually the best .
would n't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me ? please ?
echh
hello oh hi laura .
ask not what i can do for you ask what you can do for me .
no i ca n't .
why do n't get we together new years day and watch some football .
sure .
did you call me a wuss ?
all right go in the bedroom . open the window . you can go out the fire escape .
in your situation the only sex you 're going to have better than make up sex is if you 're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit .
you want to spend the rest of your life with her
too dumb ?
oh .
she could be an it .
but i ca n't help thinking that maybe there 's someone in your life who deserves it more . someone you 've known you know more than a week .
who ?
woah .
well this is it . i 'm selling .
can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig ? would you do that ?
let 's not even analyze it .
well this worked out just as i had hoped .
one of the problems in life is that when you 're a kid you have a certain way of working out disagreements . and those laws do not work in the adult world . one of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it . one of them says i got the front seat i wanted the front seat . i called it . and the other kid knows he 's got nothing to say he called it . what can i do ? if there was a kid court of law it holds up . your honour my client did ask for the front seat and the judge would go did he call it ? well no he did n't call bang . he has to call it case closed . objection overruled . '
what about the money ? apparently if i had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven i 've couldo ve got the money back . which i wouldo ve done if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter .
saving lives ? the whole profession is eh just put some aloe on it .
bania can i talk to you for a second ? how 's everything going ?
todd . oh yeah . he 's a kennedy .
yeah .
that 's a date .
oh no . i 've been kinda busy . it 's all .
hmm . so cynthia 's your mentor .
no it 's not . it 's mine . i 'm a fancy boy .
hey bobby over here .
you know you better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the brooklyn bridge
hi .
dermatologist ? skin does n't need a doctor .
oh that 's too bad .
it 's like NUM minutes by subway .
all right i 'm i m taking the camera .
but i do n't know if this is going to work .
i think that 's the statue from my house . that looks like the statue from my house .
no not on me .
but you did n't really do any work .
well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy i was visiting today was throwing away sinatra duke ellington al jolson benny goodman
all right .
oh no wait a second wait a second i i do n't know the name of this woman in the bathroom so when she comes out you introduce yourself and then she 'll be forced to say her name .
yeah he 's nuts . you wanta bump off a couple of cats . i know i know . it 's down again .
maybe he knows o'brien ?
hey wait a second . you know we could share a cab . they 're playing at the same cineplex .
at least it 's show business
yes well of course but even so you may want to talk to a lawyer .
come on . take it . it 's money . let me give it to ya .
i do n't know he 's got some valuable antiques he 's worried they 'll break something .
hi .
oh this is awful .
he might die .
sally ? wait wait a minute she 's coming to new york ?
she asked about you .
c 'mon i was sleeping with one cheek off the bed .
it 's a list of excuses it 's for that guy horneck who 's at the game tonight with my tickets . i have that list now so in case he calls i just consult it and i do n't have to see him . i need it . what are you doing ?
so what happened to you yesterday ? we were supposed to go to the auto show i waited for you you never came .
take the k man .
no . you ?
absolutely . i have no confidence in you .
look at that . why do i get bananas ? they 're good for one day

oh . too bad .
i want to .
well you were involved in some sort of amorous
kramer this is awful . we do n't want to hear about this .
are you kidding ? i could spot that birdo s nest two blocks away .
what 'd ya get ?
can you believe that ?
that pam . i am ga ga over her .
come on . let 's go .
alright .
aww right . three hundred plus fifty for the repair . three fifty that 's it .
we have n't spoken .
sniffing with his nose .
why do i always have the feeling that everybody 's doing something better than me on saturday afternoons ?
what ?
no it 's true . this woman saved my life . i was crossing the street . i was almost hit by a car and then we talked and the whole thing just seemed like a dream .
why ?
ca n't you talk to your boss ?
nah she 's really good and she 's not just a masseuse she 's a physical therapist . there 's a big difference . she uses the ultrasound it 's a real medical procedure . in fact if you get a doctor 's note it 's covered by insurance .
no .

no that 's no sweet'ning the deal . no .

vommiting is not a deal breaker . if hitler had vommited on chamberlin chamberlind still would have given him chekoslovakia .

what about you ?

hey alec .
irish scottish what 's the difference lassie ?
you 're filk .
what is that ?
yeah i 'm good for about four thousand dollars .

a circus ?
what are you talking about .
no he 's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter oh no .
so they 're like everyone else .
oh of course . todd gack . you did you bet was in star wars ? sammy davis jr .
i am not a restaurateur by any means but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native pakistan ? as opposed to say t the franks and beans for example .
yeah he 's a bad seed .
kramer she was murdered .
it 's nice to meet you .
i thought you were going out with celia ?
it 's not totally impossible .
that 's the way they do it in vegas .

okay .
i 'm looking in the first drawer . it 's not here .
oh come on .
there really building a utopian society up there huh . and you tribute all this to the calzone .
no i do n't . in fact if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it 's way across that hall i will freak out on you kramer . freak out .
oh my god .
well perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice
a rebel ? no . johnny yuma was a rebel . eckman is a nut . george you want to take care of your tonsils you do it in a hospital . with a doctor .
no no i want to . i i very much want to . i i desire to . i i pine to .
you sidle ? y you you stomp around like a clydesdale .

what is that creaking its like i 'm in the hold of a ship . got to relax . font
oh . sure . sure . you ang your work . elaine 's off in the bizarro world george only calls when he wants something ang i 'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken which by the way was for two .
she could have mentioned the conversation .
i like the way you think .
it 's a letter from the immigration bureau it 's babu 's visa renewal application form . they must have put it in my mailbox by mistake .
plus he probably does n't even know how to program the buttons .
hey georgie .
i have to go over to my grandmother 's .
it 's hard to pretend because i know where it is .
really ?
we brushed on that . actually george was in rare form . he just ca n't find anybody .
i asked because you were the mailman you would know the neighbourhood .
do n't you see ? you 're just avoiding the middle man . you were going to give her her spare keys so she was going to give em to me . so all that 's happening is that instead of giving them to her you 're giving them to me . it 's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours you did n't give her hers . cause then she would have given em to me because she has mine . so then i would have never had to ask you for hers so that i could get mine .
we could visit together .
no what ?
well why not ?
yeah it is .
you know i 'm the one responsible for those crop circles in england .
listen i want you to get the mail outta my storage unit .
i ca n't do it . look what they did to my boy they massacred my boy .
make way . i 've got i 've got a runner here . get outta the way . make way . make way . make way it 's a contender .
well you 're your own boss now .
why do n't you just break it off with her . tell her it 's over
excuse me ?
actually yeah . wait a second . is that the fork that fell on the floor ? . are you using the fork that fell on the floor ? .
nice .
so it could be anyone ?
that 's how it 's going to be .
hello newman .
i do n't know anything about that .
take a look at this card . tell me if you notice anything unusual about it .
my foot 's asleep again .
mmm
so you do n't cry when your grandmother dies ? but a hotdog makes you lose control ?
why are you doing this ?
i am very excited about this date . we 're going to hunan balcony .
either way .
why is it so difficult uncomfortable to be naked . it 's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do you feel like you 're getting it together yeah yeah pretty good feeling good looking good but when you 're naked it 's like it 's so final you 're well that 's it . there 's nothing else i can do . that 's why i like to wear a belt when i 'm naked . cause i feel it gives me something i know i 'm naked but you know i like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be would n't that be the ultimate ? to be naked and still be able to do this i think that would really help a lot .
hello newman .
what ?
we found out his super power was lack of money .
you 're robbing me .
it 's a nervous tic . i 'm on l dopa .
look it 's not like you 're going to be spending a lot of time with her .
my neighbour

ok

i mean it 's no big deal . you 're still driving . you should have been watching the road .
george likes them he feels it 's a good personality showcase . he likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality .
come on up .

well one outta twenty thousand . that 's not bad .
good .
what do you think ?
alright you 're locked up in a prison in turkey i have your wallet . the only way i can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your atm code .
oh the baby 's fine . they just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure . but look at me . i 'm the one who 's hurt .
you 're sure ?
she came down from juno by sleigh she was in the iditarod . got to the finish line just kept going . she 's got the dogs with her in the hotel room .

well ah what ? kind of like this ?
there 's a naked woman across the street .
so i assume the jig was up .

mammal .
professional tennis . to me i do n't understand all the shushing . why are they always shushing . shh shh . do n't the players know that we 're there ? should we duck down behind the seats so they do n't see us watching them ? to me tennis is basically just ping pong and the players are standing on the table . that 's all it is . and that goofy scoring you win one point and all the sudden you 're up by NUM . two points NUM love . NUM love . sounds like an english call girl . that 'll be NUM love and could you be a little quieter next time please shh .

consummation ? i do n't think you have enough material .

yeah . i mean let 's say this is your brain . okay from what i know about you your brain consists of two parts the intellect represented here and the part obsessed with sex . now granted you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap . but with no sex louise this previously useless lump is now functioning for the first time in its existence .
no . i do n't .

i am saying that the spit could not have come from behind that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road . if the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward .

it 's against the law .
well what am i supposed to do now ?
you know i know this sounds a little arrogant but i never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me . ya know i guess i had my chance and that 's that .

people are going to steal from you . you ca n't stop them . but everybody has their own little personal security things . things that they think will foil the crooks you know ? in your own mind right ? you go to the beach go in the water put your wallet in the sneaker who 's going to know ? what criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security ? i tied a bow . they ca n't get through that . i put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker . they never look there . they check the heel they move on .
kramer are you out of your mind ? you got the aids walk in like three hours . you 're never going to make it .

happy festivus .
what do you think the nazis were doin ? that was the heil five .

you know i was wondering you know that black hawks jacket you have ?
how was your flight ? pretty uncomfortable ?
even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she 's still the one who laughed .
we just want to talk to her . we want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident .
hello ?
well a law 's a law .
what 's going on here ?
showmanship george . when you hit that high note you say goodnight and walk off .
i know but i 'm distracted now .
with the smelling .
how does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment ? you ca n't talk during a movie . you know this is stupid c 'mon let 's just go .
you 're the man .
you do the tub ?
oh can lloyd really do that ?
this is far more important . you must exercise the gaskets george .
two pair ? three of a kind ?
so what happened ?
believe me . you know i forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you .
sure we can do something next week .
seems like you 're better at fake relationships than real ones .
i 've heard of ohio katie . but tuesday 's no good . i 'm doing career day at my old junior high .
what did you do the rest of the day ?
he 's from uh trinidad and tobago right ?
what has this guy got a personal vendetta with me ? . what 'd i do to him ? cos i asked him about the knicks ?
that 's it i 'm calling in the big guns .
yeah well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at NUM NUM .
i 'm locking the vault . what ?
no .
she did n't stay over ?
are we about throw here newman ?
nude backgammon with swimsuit models .
scary cold .
turn up the heat in your apartment .
dustin hoffman in star wars . ? . short jewish guy against darth vader . i do n't think so .
oh yeah i understand .
how do you figure ? cause you 're the one who left the door open .
well what happened ?

what ?
beautiful .
you know the water pressure 's terrible in my building . and she loves a good shower .
brett i 'm i 'm really sorry . i did n't mean to hit you in the head with an axe .
is this yours or the roommate 's ?
i still do n't have to go .
ho ly .
okay fine . this is the official flip . no crying no guilt winner takes all and that 's it . agreed ?
had i been taking ?
so tonight are you going to make the move ?
is there a captain 's hat involved in this ?
right . for the reducing of the pond scum ?
for either one of us
cause i 'm an idiot . you may think you 're an idiot but with all due respect i 'm a much bigger idiot than you are .
i thought you said they had a good time is there anything else you 're keeping from me ?
to me the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel . are we going to have to have aa type meetings for these people ? they 'll go hi my name is bill and the one thing i 'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream colored couch . according to most studies people 's number one fear is public speaking . number two is death . death is number two . now this means to the average person if you have to go to a funeral you 're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy .
so i guess your messiah would be the anti christ .
pretty impressive 'serious boyfriend NUM to NUM . owns her own car favorite president james polk .
i do n't read in the bathroom .

you 're telling me .
you got a date with becky gelke ? .
it was a great sounding laugh too kind of lilting and feminine none of those big coarse ha 's . you know those ?
what do you say ?
it 's kind of a stuffed meat thing . israeli soldiers carry it . in case they 're captured behind enemy lines they eat it and it kills them .
i know it 's a big problem she puts like four pieces in her mouth it 's ridiculous i do n't think we 're going to be able to get together on saturday night
yeah yeah lucky me .
what about that bavarian cream pie joke i told you ? there 's no truth to that . nobody with a terminal illness goes from the united states to europe for a piece of bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they do n't have it he says aw i 'll just have some coffee . there 's no truth to that .
naw i got to wait until its just the right time .
to basically give this money away

they know how to make em
how do you feel ?

oh . hey .
that close huh ?
women need to like the job of the guy they 're with . if they do n't like the job they do n't like the guy . men know this . which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have . well right now i 'm the regional management supervisor . i 'm in development research consulting men on the other hand if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job . are we ? men do n't really care . men 'll just go really ? slaughterhouse ? is that where you work ? that sounds interesting . so whaddaya got a big cleaver there ? you 're just lopping their heads off ? that sounds great . listen why do n't you shower up and we 'll get some burgers and catch a movie . '
still no luck
we 'll move his teeth it happened to my uncle the sugar revived him .
that 's nice for the freaks .
i 've always been a big fan of the little check move . you know check check . unless the waiter is n't too shape then you got to total it up . sometimes they come over do you want the check ? no i want to be pen pals ca n't you see what i 'm doing here ? i 'm trying to be cool and impress people .
thank you
what is with this thing .
i 'll get you another one just like it .
you can see it . you going to walk around like that ?

i did n't have an expression . i have a deviated septum . i have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe .
oh you
where you going ?
oh my god . this drawer is filled with fruit loops .
where are we ?
oh the shut ins that 's nice . you know they 're a very eccentric group . because they 're shut in . of course they 're not locked in they 're free to go at anytime .
no i do n't see it .
two minutes .
kramer .
no nothing . how could you not give a thank you wave ? hey buddy . where 's my thank you wave ?
how long did you leave it up there ?
but you ca n't act .
no i do n't want . so just tell me what i owe you for your trouble
it 's a perfect plan . so inspired . so devious . yet so simple .
no kramer i do n't want you to say anything to him .
she does n't have toe thumbs .
this is not a good time .
elaine a guy 'll say anything to get a woman .
so is this a breakupquitting ?
oh yeah that . well
no time ? is there time ?
i do n't know do you have a
live ?
if you were in the mafia would you tell her every time you killed someone ?
hi tide ?
my money 's on the snooze . i bet he hit the snooze for an extra NUM and it never came back on . imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock .
i know you will .
you let him fight ?
will you let me pay just once .
aw c 'mon you love that car . what about the northstar system ?
why ? why are they doing that ?
yes george because of society . so how did the big meeting turn out ?
would you like something to drink ?
oh . like they would n't have found that anyway .
what 's that ?
why am i wearing is now ? i 'll tell you why i 'm wearing it now because the lowtalker asked me to that 's why . and i said yes . do you know why ? because i could n't hear her .
i know . no awkward pauses . probably the reason we never fooled around
alright that 's it . the fight 's already started . i 'm going upstairs who 's coming ? elaine ?
i do n't understand it . you were having such a great time the sex the shopping .
have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg ?
oh i thought it was like an igloo .
so if i ask her out again i do n't know who 's showing up the good the bad or the ugly .
hey .
i do n't understand this
s very emasculating he does n't know the nature of our relationship . you 're there approving new clothes that 's a girlfriend job . how dare he .
hey uh what 'd you get there ?
i really have to go to the bathroom .
what should i do should i call the police ?
hey happy birthday .
hello newman .

i do n't recall you drinking caf&eacute latte .
yeah ?
you guys both have class at the same time ?
you 're a shmoopy .
hiss .
and where does it end ? then everyone 's doing it . it 's like the wave at ball games . air quotes . the phrase do n't go there . someone 's got to take a stand .
he tends to exaggerate .
you got the tap ?
you 're too nice a guy .
kramer they 're fumigating . there 's toxic gas in there .
ow . stupid fold out . why 'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed ?
yes i was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star .
obviously we 're going to call the police and tell that he 's not the guy .
what ?
oh yeah uh you 've never met my wife meryl ? meryl seinfeld .
i 'm going out with one of the miss america contestants you want to go ?
i do n't want it that way .

flying does n't make me nervous driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you 're flying when you 're getting on the plane if you miss that plane there 's no alternative . on the ground you have options . you have buses you have taxis you have trains . but when you 're taking a flight if you miss it that 's it . no airline goes well you missed the flight we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes . would you be interested in that ? it 's not a direct cannon you have to change cannons after you land . i 'm sorry where you goin ? chicago ? oh dallas ? alright wait a second dallas . that 's about dallas . texas anyway . you should hit texas . are you ready ? make sure you get out of the net immediately because we shoot the luggage in right after you .

nah it 's better anyway . i mean really . what was going to happen ? i 'm a comedian . how can i go out with a girl with a laugh like that ? i mean izz it 's like ah it 's like coco chanel going out with a fish monger . you know cause she 's with all the perfumes and a fish monger 's pretty bad smell .
i know what this is . you saw that show on pbs last night coronary country . i saw it in the tv guide . i called him and told him to make sure and not watch it .
that 's because you did n't win .
it .
no .
inside the van ?
up state . hummm .
well i do .
you do n't even know what a write off is .
really ? did you hear that ? somebody else was killed .
not bad . wuh what does she
no i 'm afraid we 'll start talking and i 'll going to wind up going partners with him .
you know it 's not like changing toothpaste .
well as i see it you 've got to apply the same principles that get you fired but redirected outwardly .
it 's like i 'm talking to my aunt sylvia here .
oh go ahead .
are you serious ?
what 's with the signs ?
you 're lucky they let you drive a car .
what happened ?
i 'm glad we had this talk .
whattya mean ?
you may have a point .
yeah but it 's like another comedian stealing my material .
what about ?
hey . how would you like to go to the super bowl ?
well my friend it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus .
pretentious . ? the woman has my tax papers . you told her she was pretentious ? the irs . they 're like the mafia . they can take anything they want
vermont . with any luck they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to . four days at a beautiful bed and breakfast . i ca n't wait buy bye . what ? what is this ?
hi julie .
NUM years .

hey kramer look at this .

hey it 's okay .
see now that i do n't care for .
then he asked you out ?
they 're right behind the dugout george first row .
no . all you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver .
i do n't know but you look like you 're happy .
because your parents are going down there . my buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet . you got to do something .
oh that 's the flicks .
yeah .
i 'm calling dentists all day here there 's nobody working the day before thanksgiving .
um uh . and we 're going out saturday night .
keep following him kramer . do n't let me down .
are you sure you did n't hear my car making a funny noise ? i know those two idiots did something to it .
they just wanted the armoire ?
cause you know i love elaine .
yes that is a definite possibility .
technically you 're saut&eacute ed . so what are you doing for that ?
no do n't cancel it .
this is george this is kramer .
she knew that .
oh george brought home movies of his boyhood trip to michigan .
what is this ? what are we doing ? what in godo s name are we doing ?
what if i lose it ?
ya . hey you know what as i was leaving i bumped into phil titola . he is one of the greatest guys .
it still smells .
i forgot to take it off .
towards what end ?
oh . taht 's judgment . yes yes . judgment with earrings on . yeah .
oh it 's my parents . my father came up to see a back specialist .
do you want box or hanger ?
oh he 's uh helping me sort my receipts . i 'm being audited .
oh hi .
it has nothing to do with whose house it is .
i guess after that many beers he 's probably a little groggy anyway .
no no no . just hypothetically .
c 'mon c 'mon go ahead move up .
why do n't you ask that doctor what it is ?
now my sense of it is that you 're probably wasting time working piecemeal first cleaning one area then another .
maybe it 's in the lost and found .
yeah ?
male roommate huh ?
yeah .
ha ha ha . ha ha ha ha .
i have uromysitisis . it 's very serious you know .
hey it 's the k man . maybe it 's time you got a different hobby .

yeah .
oh . yeah .
what about you shmoopy ? how bout a little tuna ? you want a little tuna fishy ?

how do you know ?
no one 's going to have a better gift than this big screen tv . good for them love the drake .
boy that brain never stops working does it ?
i guess that 's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade .
all right . anyway the point i was making before goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger . c 'mon uncle leo i 've seen the way women look at you . when 's the last time you looked in a mirror ? you 're an adonis . you 've got beautiful features lovely skin you 're in the prime of your life here you should be swinging . if i were you i 'd tell this lydia character it 's been real move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign open for business .
kramer let 's do this later .
nodding off
do n't you see what 's happening here ? it 's attached itself to me . it 's alive .

always helpful .
come on let 's eat something .
uh huh .
you do n't like the drake ?
huh .
because of ted danson .
yeah yeah i know . this would be good but it would be the same . but if we go some place else it would be different but it might not be as good . it 's a gamble . i get it .
why ? it did n't mean anything . i was just trying to join in so you would n't feel embarrassed .
hello what ? you 're kidding . i 'm turning it on . oh my god . get out of here . hey listen to this . they issued a warrant for genderson 's arrest . he escaped and the police spotted him on the new jersey turnpike .

george marla .
well george does n't think $NUM NUM is enough money .
here read this .
i wonder where elaine is sitting ? i really wanted you to meet her she 's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend tony
kramer you 're fighting children ? .
it 's great . it speeds up the intimacy level . it 's like putting the relationship in a time compressor . where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days .
i hear it 's ah beautiful there .
they 're only comfortable with their equipment .
hey how was the meeting ?
phil hi . i i know we got off to kind of a bad start . but your bird which is lovely by the way made a mess on my door .
let me see that . that is high .
what is it ?
why not ?
oh so there 's still hope .
george ?
hey you know when superman saves someone no one asks if he 's trying to hit on her .
he 's a bubble boy .
we 're doing fine . how are you ?
i think the candy comes out over there .
look at the size of his bird .
oh here she comes .
but you took a nap in it .
i think she saw it coming .

all right . as you walk in the place move immediately to your right .
we got along beautifully .
hello poppie .
i hate the counter .
are you nuts ? there 's no way i 'm holding that thing .
i hate rental cars . nothing ever works the window does n't work the radio does n't work and it smells like a cheap hooker or is that you ?
what ? what news ?
well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business .
when you were with her you said you could n't stand her .
what happened to you ?
ah so this is the fortress of solitude .

you 're out of your mind you know that .
elaine i need you to do me a big favor . i need you to go down to the diplomat 's club and meet bridget for me . i 'm going to be late .
aw i doubt you strained it . maybe you pulled it .
kramer bumper cars ?
you know what the odds are on a crash it 's a million to one .
oh . but i do . there 's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar .
so you just need some guys that could roll em ?
i do n't want cantaloupe now .
bye dad . take it easy .
ampm .
front first that 's how you park when you 're pulling a bank job .
friday ?
it 's kramer .
marla kramer .
i would lose that .
you know the message you 're sending out to the world with these sweat pants ? you 're telling the world i give up . i ca n't compete in normal society . i 'm miserable so i might as well be comfortable .
how 'd it taste ?
that might be the stupidest thing you 've ever said .
kramer .
it 's better than dondi .
good idea . there 's a beach towel on the rack yeah .
yeah .
i 'm asking .
alright listen alright . how much longer is it going to be ?
i mean who has a funeral on a wednesday ? that 's what i want to know . i mean it 's the championship i 'm hitting everything .

the new york yankees ? .
i 'll tell you what i 'll give you my number and uh just give me a call tell me whenever you want to go .
you know sometimes i get the feeling george is n't being completely honest with me .
all right nik . that 's it .
you do n't understand . this is fragile frankie merman . when we were in camp if you upset him he 'd run out to the woods dig a hole and sit in it .
i 'm going .
well it 's too much it 's embarrassing
is there something i can help you with ?
oh that 's nice . alright i 'll see you later .
hug is definitely good .
oh this is interesting .
you know the only way to really help her is to just let her be .
that i heard .
you were living in the village then right ?
it ca n't be
kramer what did you do ?
and you broke up with her cuz she beat you at chess ? that 's pretty sick .
you mean golf ?
and you were integral .
is this the proper venue ?
seth if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me ? font
i mean really what 's the point of saving it ? i could see if i had a mantel .
no next wednesday . if it was tonight i wouldo ve said tonight .
sorry sorry i 'm late .
elaine ? .
who was in town on a business venture and um
i was n't thinking . i do n't know .
get out . get out . i do n't want to live like this .
oh . let me ask you a question . was the movie part of the bet ?
why are you shouting ?
what is it ?
i ca n't believe it . you know better than to get involved with kramer .
really ? they bought the butler character ?
hospital receives grant to conduct dna research government funds genetic research at area hospital yeah so ?

yeah that 's real interesting . elaine listen tell me if you think this is funny men definitely hit the remote more than women men do n't care what 's on tv men only care what else is on tv . women want to see what the show is before they change the channel because men hunt and women nest . '
hey it 's the bootlegged death blow that i shot .

so you bought a cooler ?
you 're a lifesaver . would you get them please ?
oh i do n't know . i told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life . she 's not really dead if we find a way to remember her .
oh the gum .
maybe they should have a toilet paper museum . would you like that ? so we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages . toilet paper of the crusades the development of the perforation the first six pack . . .

jim fowler ? the animal guy from wild kingdom is coming to your apartment ?
hi nina . this is my friend george .
oh yeah . too bad . angela . lousy thug . i mean what kind of sick person does something like that ? that woman belongs in prison . i mean i actually owe it to society to do something about this . i ca n't sit by and allow this to go on . it 's a moral issue is what it is .

no . how many times do i have to go out with her before i get a massage ?
you talked to him ?
well i 'm not dating any other deaf women .
no no news . you better get out of here .
yeah that 's a point
why were you making gravel ?
i said yes but i do n't feel right about it . i mean i hardly know the guy . that 's a big step oin a relationship . the biggest . that 's like going all the way .
no it 's ok .

rachel .
no she said it was fine . there 's something very strange about this girl .
i 'll remember that .
what is that music ?

it 's like a game of tag .
all right newman one more peep outta you you 're out of the whole operation .

oh okay .
the charlie macarthy hearings .

yeah i know how you feel .
hey board of directors . look at you .
no wait a minute newman . you ca n't let this dream die . you moving away is my dream too .
no thanks . but i ordered a pizza . you want some of it ?
it was my fault i told her the wrong door .
mmm mmm . too bad you 're engaged .
you know if you do n't bring a guest they save a catering . you should be able to buy a cheaper gift .
see never bet against the backslide . i knew you two would get back together .
your butler ?
well maybe the test was gender bias you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles
h hey kramer wait up . i 'll go with you .
why . you took a shower ? '
course you know there is always the possibility that she called an audible .
what happened to vincent ?
i do n't want it .
yes i do .
a cop car .
take care .
hey elaine .
you know i 'd like to hear about this job of yours
ta da .
alright i 'll see you thursday night right ?
it 's been known to happen telling you right now elaine this guy s going to dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule .
yeah .
here we go .
what is that anyway ?
i 'm feeling a bit queasy myself . maybe i 'll see you in another five years .
dating is really starting to get embarrassing is n't it ?
why they want you to fire raquel welch ?
you 're moving to new york ? that 's fantastic . i can see you all the time now .
alright alright . i 'll wake em up .
i got to get out of this cab
a relationship is an organism . you created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you . same thing happened in the blob .
bania ?
it 's here .
absolutely .
that would be an interesting sociological experiment . you know kramer has his father 's band . he 'd loan it to you .
i came to pick you up .
well sometimes we do actually have to get up early but a man will always trade sleep for sex .
where 'd you get plans ?
good to have you back .
could n't be the guy nah .
pff .
is florida not hot and muggy enough for these people ? they love heat . i mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun i think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it . they 'll just sit there on the sun on the redwood benches washcloth on the head going close the door you 're letting all the heat off the sun . i 'm trying to get a sweat going . '
i guess cause it 's her job . it 's very frustrating .
you and your toilets .
well it 's just that you got so many things with the milk . you got that bosco bit then you got your nestl&eacute 's quik bit by the time you get to ovaltine
how could you swim in that water ?
yeah it was ok . frankenstein did n't seem quite right to me . i missed the sport jacket .
no . so now you 're going to his apartment ? i really think this is nuts .
certainly are .
what is the difference ?
well actually we kind of broke up .
the woman 's movement just ca n't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery can they ?
that 's right i 'm taking a dive .
well i do n't know if i
how much ?
you know this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world .
i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner well it 's ruined . and of course the dry cleaner can respond it 's not our fault . we 're not responsible . we just ruin the clothes . that ends our legal obligation . you see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible . th right ? they 're cleaning our clothes but they 're not getting anything wet . it 's all dry . i know there 's got to be some liquids back there some fluids that they 're using . there 's no such thing as dry cleaning . when you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that that 's dry cleaning . i do n't think that 's what they 're doing back there . they do n't have eighty guys going come on hurry up . there 's a lot of shirts today . '
all right . that 's it i ca n't work like this .
hey . i heard the good news .
uh huh yeah okay thanks anyway bye .
i like to use my own material .
hey .

maybe' . ?
all right let 's go . hey you know you owe me one .
well it 's going to make mr costanza very happy .
here we go .
you faked with me ?

hi . ah look i know i do n't have an appointment but it 's really important that i talk with julianna .

i have other stuff . y you should come see me on the weekend .
so you called .
well i if it 's your day off i really

except the store 's in delaware .

maybe a little . ah hell i guess it is .
and who is on the show ? who are the characters ?
try elaine .
yeah let me ask you a question . how do you cross those wires ?
you do n't want to go with me ?
i shouldo ve talked to her i love chinese women .
how can you do this ?
the dating world is not a fun world it 's a pressure world it 's a world of tension it 's a world of pain and you know if a woman comes over to my house i got to get that bathroom ready cause she needs things . women need equipment . i do n't know what they need . i know i do n't have it i know that you know what they need women seem to need a lot of cotton balls . this is the one i 'm always has been one of the amazing things to me i have no cotton balls we 're all human beings what is the story ? i 've never had one i never bought one i never needed one i 've never been in a situation when i thought to myself i could use a cotton ball right now . i can certainly get out of this mess . women need them and they do n't need one or two they need thousands of them they need bags they 're like peat moss bags have you ever seen these giant bags ? they 're huge and two days later they 're out they 're gone the the bag is empty where are the cotton balls ladies ? what are you doing with them ? the only time i ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket there 's two or three that look like they 've been through some horrible experience tortured interrogated i do n't know what happened to them . i once went out with a girl who 's left a little zip lock baggy of cotton balls over at my house . i do n't know what to do with them i took them out i put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds . i thought maybe the cockroaches would see it figure this is a dead town . let 's move on . the dating world is a world of pressure . let 's face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night . the only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you 'll end up naked at the end of it . you know ? well bill the boss thinks you 're the man for the position why do n't you strip down and meet some of the people you 'll be working with ?
salsa seltzer . hey excuse me you got any salsa ? no not selzer salsa . what 's the matter ?

when did this happen ?
oh good men love that .
so what did you do there all day ?
i i have to say something . with all due respect i just never i ca n't imagine anyone in any walk of life under any circumstance wanting to make their own pizza pie but that 's me . alright
does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day ?
it 's impossible
you must have done something wrong . you probably screwed up the order . did you close with the swirl ?
kramer he 's just a dentist .
so . i figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another .
what happened to the rules ? remember ? sleeping over was optional .
but not at dinky .
hey salado s got nothing on this mutton .
why ?
you know make a good impression .
that 's what a gym teacher once told me .
so you 're going to wear em no matter what the situation ?
yes mr . bevilacqua .
go ahead .
oh do n't threaten me butcher boy .
all right . hey you know what 's weird ?
yeah yeah . whatever . alright i 'll see you .
oh i ca n't begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial .
are you sure ?
oh hi . elaine this is sally .
no . enjoy your lunch .

why ?
i would n't worry about it . b NUM ?
he can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce .
strike two .
you 're donna chang ?
what are you all out of breath from ?
because a real wizardo s two hundred dollars .
i do n't want you to call him .
oh yeah i like this idea .
well this is all very sophisticated .
what do you mean ?
that 's right you let him have it .
around eleven .
are you just screwing with me ?
what could possess anyone to throw a party ? i mean to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room .
hey t bone .
you see ah uh
well he and i starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me .
this actress playing elaine she 's out of her mind .
all right you guys listen i 've got to wait here for elaine i 'll meet you in front of the theatre .
hello yeah yes it is really ah ah could you hold on a second ? hey listen to this some woman found an electronic organizer my name was in it she wants me to help her track down the owner .
yeah but i 've seen pictures of her .
it 's not a surprise party . yeah
it 's like trying to smoke a chicken bone .
well i do n't mind someone with a phony personality but i got to draw the line somewhere .
hey you think that shelly 's upset that i made such a big deal about the pecan .

i have a friend who 's a hypochondriac always thinks he 's sick never is . and they you have another type of person always thinks they 're well not matter how bad they really are . you know this type of person ? very annoying . feel great like being on the respirator intravenous heartlung machine . i never felt better in my life . medical science is making advances every day in control health problems . in fact it 's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack you know becomes like a head ache . we 'll just see people on tv going i had a heart attack this big but i gave myself one of these . clear . brrhht and it 's gone . '
what about the van wyck ?

hey do you think i 'm phony ?
like a grandmother why ?
i really do n't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled .
oh pepe . yeah pepe . and uh he was making tamales .
yeah she was on his right side . he ca n't make a move with his left hand . ca n't go left .
well he sure worked pretty fast with elaine .
lainy .

typical rich people using the world for their personal garbage can .
i do n't want to .
yes .
why not ?
hey look at this guy .

so eventually these people came and somebody gave him mouth to mouth .
her back hurts .

i had a parakeet when i was a kid that was the only pet that i really enjoyed . we used to let him out of his cage and he would fly around and my mother had built one entire wall of our living room was mirrored . she felt this gives you a feeling of space . have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room ? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes hey look there 's a whole nother room in there . there 's a guy in there looks just like me . but the parakeet will fall for this you 'll let him out of his cage he flies around the room bang . with his little head he would just go click ohh . and i 'd always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room why does n't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet ?
c 'mon .

larry wait you do n't understand .

oy ga vault .

i 've been waiting a while for this . you know it 's a shame tony got all banged up we 're not going to be able to get together on saturday night
well i uh maxed out my credit cards and i do n't have enough cash for a hotel room . so
look you can hang out here if you want .
your spare set ?
let me ask you a question .
uh you know why do n't you go first you just had a long trip .
miffed .
especially that big kid up in the front . how old is he ? hello ?
well thank you very much it 's about time .
yes .
oh we 're still going we 're still going . elaine do the spokes model .
elaine . no . no .
oh god it 's mike moffit
elaine he windexed the little peep hole .
oh a walk well
now you know you 're supposed to take these things before you get sick ?
oh well thank you marcelino .
the amazing thing is you never have any place to go .
that 's good stuff .
hey what are you doing tomorrow ? you want to come see me on the charles grodin show ?
let go elaine .
ma it has nothing to do with the culottes .
the whole system is breaking down .
this old thing ?
hello . no she 's not here . yes i will tell her . no i do n't know what time she might be coming back . look i got to go . goodbye . . . . that that 's a long story .
no for both .
clare thanks for giving me a second chance . our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly stupid voice . hold on one second . so we definitely do n't want to do the voice anymore ? alright we 're back together again great . bye bye .
no that 's the rule . it 's optional .
cause i 've seen these pregnant women and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth . just like one wrong turn and boom . and entire buffet is swept off the table .
breakfast ?
uh excuse me . i could n't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie .
um . i 'll call you back ok ?
do you think it 's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle ?
so you want to take a ride with me out to jersey ? i 'm going to try to sell the van to a lot .
of course .
oh it 's damaged .
i got to get on that internet . i 'm late on everything .
what ?
thank you . if we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch would we sit right next to each other ?
alright .
boy i know she really wants to see that with me .
he did ?
yeahh .
the omelet . damn .
tell you what . if they win the penant i 'll sit naked with you at the world series .
get together ?
seth . wow what has it been like five years ? font
this guy 's a writer he 's a total nut . i think he goes to the same shrink as elaine .
yeah . well she was very affectionate which i love . you know i love that but mentally we could n't quite make the connection .
oh no nothing .
i mean look at this . every waitress working here has the same proportions . would n't you say ?
you 'll get your tape . but here 's what i 'm going to need . i 'm going to need three cameras two on the floor one in the balcony . and i want headsets for the guys running em . i want to be able to talk to em .
so i think we should just forget the whole deal and go back to being friends .
no . would you just get out ?
uh huh ?
what 's that ?
well i 'm upset but we 'll make the most of it .
people like the idea of revenge . have you ever heard the expression the best revenge is living well i 've said this in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life . sounds nice does n't really work on that charles bronson . kinda level . you know what i mean those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum . you think you could go up to him charlie forgot about the NUM what you need is a custom made suit and a convertible . new carpeting french doors a divan . that 'll show those punks . '
she said i was n't sponge worthy . would n't waste a sponge on me .
oh . that would be great .
how am i going to do that ?
what do you need them for ?
so it 's like going to idhao and eating carrots . i like carrots but i 'm in idhao i want a potato .
my mother has never set foot in a natural body of water .
i 'm very sorry .
course you may not see it for twenty years .
give me the clothes .
it certainly has .
we do n't know . he says ask somebody ask that guy .
the former still applies . i do n't know what it is but i just ca n't see you with a mechanic .
uh no he 's taking the car .
she 's your lex luthor .
to me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that i did work in an office . is that when you go in in the morning you say hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them . i mean you walk in morning bill morning bob how you doing ? fine ten minutes later you see him in the hall how ya doin ? every time you pass you got to come up with another little greeting . you know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow hey you start coming up with nicknames for them . jimbo . '
aahh .
he 's back . and i knew he would be someday . man that 's some tart cider .
so why do n't you just try your blow off number and see if he 's called it ?
yeah me too
you know george just because your life is destroyed do n't destroy someone else 's .
yes . and the mentor advises the prot&eacute g&eacute .
almost . hey new timberlands ?

and that waist cincher that was the topper .
hey look i 'm going to pay for that .
yes but
hello karen ? it 's jerry seinfeld . oh that 's very sweet of you . you know you better be careful you do n't want to get too congenial . they 'll slap that miss congeniality on you and you 'll congene yourself right out of the contest . so what time do you want to get together later ? what ? so what we do n't need the chaperone . the chaperone ca n't make it . oh you 're not going to get disqualified . so we 're not going ? hold on one second . hey what are you doing tonight ?
yeah you in ?
well that 's it . look i 'm going to vermont . i do n't want to think about this . i 'm selling .
i read it in ann landers .
oh my god george .
oh my god lorraine that 's lorraine from my uncle 's office . i 'm in big big trouble .
the point is i intend to undertake this . and i 'll do it with or without you . so if you 're scared if you have n't got the stomach for this let 's get it out right now . and i 'll go on my own . if not you can get on board and we can get to work . now what 's it going to be ?
something to drink ?
what are you telling him for ?
all right .
it 's like this all the time .
this is amazing .
good . what 's the matter ?
um you know it 's the damnedest thing . it went away .
he offered it to me .
what happened to you ?
you know i think he wears a piece .
yeah you must have meant clara barton .
all right . okay . sports movies talk show host . what else ?
really ?
kramer look it 's george .

i reckon .
i thought you just said she does n't know ?
buh bye .
reversed positions ?
give me that .
oh great . that 's great . what a night .
it was in the back of the room on the left she must have been sitting right in front of it .
no one 's ever written me a letter like this . maybe i was wrong about her .
they 're afraid they 'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck . kramer does n't want a record .
yeah i know .
what 's this ?
boy they seem pretty angry about something .
what ? what did what did you say ?
what ?
oh no . i explained the whole thing to him he was fine with it .
sex that 's meaningless i can understand that but dinner that 's heavy . that 's like an hour .
that guy elaine 's dating seems really familiar to me . i think he may have been a comedian i worked with one time . wait a minute what is this ?
i 'm jerry seinfeld i tell jokes for a living but there 's no joking about the financial crisis here at pbs . our lines are open so please call the number you see on your screen .
i do n't want to stop her .

i think that 's a little extreme .
it 's easier for a woman not to do it than a man .
i do n't give out bites . i got another one . but i 'm saving it for later .
i think if one 's going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note . it 's common courtesy . i do n't know . that 's just the way i was brought up .

double good bye .
uh listen this is important . tell him to meet me at the tv studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her .
oh like you do .
latex ? and what do i do with latex ?
hey my parents are just as crazy as your parents .

tuberculosis
it makes no sense now me being murphy .
ya
if i wind up sitting next to uncle leo i am leaving . he 's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me . i guess it 's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation .
well she 's here . she just did n't get around to it .
mmm bad how ?
well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down . it 's a business .
kramer ? what did we say that 's so bad ?
how about that guy writing a check for NUM . NUM ?
oh right . the big party

i 'm not doing your bits .
swinging ? what are you out of your mind ? look at you you 're disgusting . you 're bald you 're paunchy all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty four hours a day . if there 's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds you should hang on to her like grim death . which is not far off by the way .
yeah because they would be very demanding people .
ok

it was unbelievable . you 're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman .
you know you 're not chinese

i admit it . i do n't watch it .
do you want to go with him ? you go . i do n't mind .

maybe the fat camp . you 're not going ?
the crook has the machine . the messages are n't for him . he 's the crook . why would he answer how did you get in here ?
she happy for you ?
let 's get out of here .
i guess i 'm coming . i mean
you do n't know ? come on that 's gold .
the point is i 'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle 's going to be going wild .
look vanessa of course the market fluctuates . everybody knows that . i just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars .
is n't it common knowledge ?
ah the sweet stench of failure .
no .
definitely . well goodnight .
maybe elaine put in a good word for you .
what date ? it 's a guy .
we have to do it . it 's part of our lifestyle . it 's like uh shaving .
see you later .
i ca n't go .
i 'm sure it did n't move .
i see you there ramon .
i did a show for a car dealership and they 're getting me a new saab .
talk show host . that 's good .
i 'm not going there . did n't he get busted by the board of health ?
but we got to make it seem like we 're not calling for dates .
where are you sitting ?
so marcelino 's going to take down the check ?
so we 're giving him nothing ?
anybody want to take a walk down to NUM street ? i think i may have tracked down another receipt .
so what ever happened with that ?
well what is it you object to ? the comfort ? the speed ? the convenience ?
she does not .
george did you get that chair yet ?
ooo that was a bad toast .
wood is good .
and you misinterpret this how ?
would do you think ?
marine biology .
how can you lose ?
i get it .
if i get it for you will you take me to that club ang show me a good time ?
that 's their policy .
oh you dig ?
this puddle on my sofa .
every time i turn on the tv sirens are going to go off . they 're going to track me down like a dog i know it
well we
you do n't think she 's attractive ?
hello oh hi elaine what 's going on no he just left you broke up with him ? me too what happened ? oh smoking you know you 're like going out with c . everet coope me nah i could n't go through with it i just did n't feel ready so what are you doing now ? oh great idea i 'll meet you there in like thirty minutes . okay bye .
do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this ? he knew i was going to know it 's missing and he took it . and of all things to take . i left my watch tape recorder stereo . he 's crazy .
i see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something . that 's my overview .
swimming ?
leo i saw you steal .
oh really do you ? well it just so happens that i did pour water out . i had a bottle of very tepid water and i poured it out . and i could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating .
hey tim .
hey .
it 's not true .
hey . you know i do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like .
the real peterman reality bus tour . i 'm confused .
so ?
but you ca n't see there 's no lenses in those frames .
you think you can get him to just change teams ? he 's not going to suddenly switch sides . forget about it .
no . no pick .
and she was beautiful in that bra . i 'm crazy about her . i love her whole free swinging free wheeling attitude .
this is like the meeting of smith and wesson .
are you through ?
let 's do it .
that 's ridiculous i want to return it . what 's the difference what the reason is .
to our future wives yeah
i think it 's fantastic . i think it 's a fantastic idea .
is that a thick marble ?
all right we 're taking a car service . so we 'll swing by and pick you up . how about six ? . six is good . . you got a problem with six ? . what ? what ?
so how 's your karate class going ?
yeah
well i 'm glad it 's working out .
because if you think she 's too good for george you are dead wrong . dead wrong . who is she ?
yeah
sue ellen mishke the braless o henry candy bar heiress .
she knew who i was . she saw me in a club one time . my first date ever with the pacific rim . i 'm very excited .
what about nbc ? did you hear anything ?
can we go out there ?
where are your clothes ?
he wants me to help him move .
that 's because she had my mail .
yeah .
no last one . listen you got to help me out . elaine and puddy just broke up he 's treating me just like a regular customer now .
ok .
we were too compatible our conversations were so engrossing .
all fathers are intimidating . they 're intimidating because they are fathers . once a man has children for the rest of his life his attitude is to hell with the world i can make my own people . i 'll eat whatever i want i 'll wear whatever i want and i 'll create whoever i want . '
okay .
i heard he used to polish off a box of triscuits .
and the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the superficial man .
no kidding ?
just . . . do it .
what kind of pie are you cooking ?
they really stick to that understudy rule .
that is out there .
well so what if i said that ?
what can i do ? break up with him ? tell him i do n't think we 're right for each other . he 's a guy . at least with a woman there 's a precendent . you know the relationship goes sour you end it .
so i 'm going through the airport and i have to put my bag on that little uh uh the uh that uh the conveyor belt .
i would n't worry about it .
sons of bitches ?
why no t bone ?
i know i know .
you do n't understand someone 's after us a crazy clown is trying to kill us .
i 'm calling you one if you are one are you a liar ?
that 's true . but it was an accident . and i have n't done it since . and i would never do it again . and if you continue cursing you 'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up . excuse me one second .
that 's it that 's it . you like having this over me you do n't want me to do it .
oh no .
how much was under there ?
i 'll wait .

listen to this i do n't know what you expect to find out there jerry you know what you want better than me . but there 's one thing i do know . i know i can stand here watching you destroy everything i 've ever wanted in my life wanting to smash your face with my fists because you wo n't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that i love you . you mean so much to me that i 'm will ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity . '
you 're cold ?
you need a little pioneer spirit . you know you do n't have any of that lewis and clark in you .
that 's what 's so fascinating .
and billy and jake and allison yes we could have discussed it .
i 'm sorry . there 's no reason for her not to taste that pie .
i 'm sorry elaine i 'll make it up to you .
um i have n't got my watch on . it 's being fixed .
well i do n't know how official any of these rankings really are .
there is no way ellen is the loser of that group .
why ?
whatever you want .

what is all the racket back there ? you know you 're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with . what is going on ?
yeah . because of you .
two hundred . but i 'll tell him it 's fifty . he does n't care about the gift . he gets excited about the deal .
that 's nice of you to say .
i know .
prediction . i never see you or him again for the rest of my life .
not that i would think of doing such things .
well it looks like you 've adjusted to the boxers

is this okay ? can i do this ?
hello newman .
no thanks .

i said boy am i ugly .
what does that mean ?
hunger will make people do amazing things . i mean the proof of that is cannibalism . cannibalism what do they say i mean they 're eating and you know this is good who is this ? i like this persong . you know i mean i would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep you know what i mean ? i would think you 'd be like who is that ? who 's there ? who 's there ? is somebody there ? what do you want ? what do you want ? you look hungry are you hungry ? get out of here . '
what 's all this stuff ?
which flavor ?
but i 'm keeping it . as much as i hate the idea of being a van guy it 's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people .
i gave you a taste . what do you want ?
i do n't think that 's salman .
were you talking ? i could n't hear anything .
i do n't feel like eating .

first of all you 're not even supposed to have elaine 's keys . you 're supposed to give em back to her so she can give em back to me because she has mine . so technically those are my keys .

half of show business is here .
no i do n't think so . i saw newman as i was leaving but see me .

well birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we 've grown . no matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge with each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it 's not to be that for the rest of our sad wretched pathetic lives this is who we are to the bitter end . inevitably irrevocably happy birthday ? no such thing .
odds .
see it 's never as bad as you imagine .
you 'll sense it .

tremendous workout .

oh right .
ahh .
i was the last one on the end . george was next to me . and mr . bevilacqua the gym . . .
kramer i 'm kind of in the middle of something . would you get these signs out of here please ?
so it 's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul .
i 'm with you .
kramer what the hell is going on in there ?
come on . one shot i can do it i know i can do it .
i 've never been a guinea pig . i 've been a sheep a tody .
good shake . perfect shake . single pump not too hard you know does n't have to prove anything but you know firm enough to know he was there .
so what did she do ?
there 's really not that much to tell .
it 's early .
yeah i washed it .
so when do i get my dinner ?
make them interesting .
i do n't want it
well it must be comforting to know you 'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour .
yeah .
well
she 's full . so big daddy . i 'm just curious . how much did you clear on your little transaction there all told ?
i know i was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his NUM years in the business he 's never smelled anything like it .

i can tell you what to think .
n na i 'm paying for the trip .
susan 's parents ? when 's the last time you talked to them ?
what 's amazing to me about the library is it 's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you 're done . it reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend . that 's what the library is . a government funded pathetic friend . and that 's why everybody kinds of bullies the library . i 'll bring it back on time i 'll bring it back late . oh what are you going to do ? charge me a nickel ?
a matron ?
because he thinks i was lying and i want to show him i was n't .
you 're bringing a date to a party ?

oh alright ah well there 's a priest a minister and a rabbi and they 're all staring at him
sorry i 'm late i just came from a meeting with my lawyer .

george letting my emotions out was the best thing i 've ever done . sure i 'm not funny anymore but there 's more to life than making shallow fairly obvious observations . how about you ?
wow . coming out of the shower it 's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up what is this an ad for ?

he 's serving mexican italian chinese . he 's all over the place . that 's why no one 's going in .
matthew luke paul' what you 're cheating on your conversion chest ?

so she 's giving me the massage and i 'm just making conversation .
yes . well be that as it may if you could just find it in yourself to give it up .
you just missed him . he just left . what do you need him for ?
so ?
the food court is closed .
oh nobody 's calling off any weddings . alright it 's time to go . come on up .
oh that restaurant on top of the chrysler building ? yeah that 's a good idea .

kramer .
alright .
so ?
well i 'll tell you what you 've got here .
alright i 'm waiting . i i want to see the pig man . show me the pig man .
bridget .
i do n't even want to talk about it anymore . what were you thinking ? what was going on in your mind ? artistic integrity ? where where did you come up with that ? you 're not artistic and you have no integrity . you know you really need some help . a regular psychiatrist could n't even help you . you need to go to like vienna or something . you know what i mean ? you need to get involved at the university level . like where freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you . that 's the kind of help you need . not the once a week for eighty bucks . no . you need a team . a team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you having conferences observing you like the way they did with the elephant man . that 's what i 'm talking about because that 's the only way you 're going to get better .
nah . you two go .
oh no . do n't tell me . you like him ?
how 's your family history ?
this is jerry seinfeld .
bottle wipe supercedes it .
well we went out one time . do n't you think that 's coming on a little too strong ?
listen buddy
you 're beautiful .
so i did n't like the crest all that much . but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store i told i wanted to see what someone else thought and then he makes a face like he does n't believe me .
what ? .
you know the difference between a dentist and a sadist do n't you ?
she would n't take her coat off at my house either .
it was just an innocent comment . i did n't know she had a pony .
you 're nuts .
i did n't know she had a pony . how was i to know she had a pony ? who figures an immigrant 's going to have a pony ? do you know what the odds are on that ? i mean in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats coming into new york harbor i never saw one of them sitting on a pony . why would anybody come here if they had a pony ? who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non pony country ? it does n't make sense . am i wrong ?
i just wanted you to scare him .
aub ah gipple ?
no you do n't understand it 's not what you think . it was an accident .
yeah but how could you be so sure ?
i dunno how you could forget . he kept reffering to himself in the third person . jimmy 's under the boards . jimmy 's in the open . jimmy makes the shot . '
and by then you 've lost interest .
where is your key ?
i had a great time at the last one . i was in charge of the music . i turned that mother out .
like this ?
the black leather thing with a strap .
oh my god . number one . seinfeld you magnificent bastard .

she 's an eskimo actually .
i hear you 're going out with david putty .
well you ca n't just mention it and then not tell me .
are you kidding ? people love it . there 's something about the clip clop clip clop . they 're nuts for it .
well perhaps we should inquire . poppie . oh poppie . could i have a word ?
it 's very good cantaloupe . so that 's it ? you 're out ?
i 'm not stopping you from eating . go ahead and eat . get anything you want .
moved ?
ah no problem . that 's fine .

it 's not going to be anything . i returned the book . i remember it very vividly because i was with sherry becker . she wore this orange dress . it was the first time i ever saw her in a dress like that . in oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years . and then one day
thus ends the great ball man experiment .
but of course we 'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems . maybe some rules or something .
i
we 've been trying to get it out of him for ten years . what is it ?
i ca n't .
hi .
she must be psychotic or something .
oh my god .
yeah it 's very good .
hey ronnie .

what do you think it couldo ve been just some dude ?
oh wait a second i believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen . hey dick i do n't know what your problem is . it 's not my fault you 're back on the wagon .

the problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing . i think life would be a lot better if it was like you 're always making a movie . you mess up somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot . you know what i mean ? think of the things you wish you could take back . you 're out somewhere with people gee you look pregnant are you ? cut cut cut cut cut that 's not going to work at all . walk out the door and come back in . let 's take this whole scene again . people think about what you 're saying . '
mother of god .

acting .
well you 're looking well .
hello hello . is glen there ? i 'm sorry . is this NUM NUM NUM ? yes i know i have the wrong number but i just want to know if i dialed wrong or if
how 's the sexual chemistry ?
oh hi .

the commotion also delayed production of a woody allen movie that was shooting up the block . a spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that mr . allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in new york were over .
well i am sure i had a good reason .
kramer .
excuse me ?
how could she be smarter than you ?
she looks like something out of an old high school yearbook . you should say something to her .
i do n't know but we do n't have much time .
alright i 'm going to get this . this looks good .
course not .
no it 's like bo and cologne they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk .
kramer the mets have got men on base .
you see now i really do n't want to get into this any kind of specifics
what ?
i guess we 'll never know .
i ca n't listen to anymore of this the guy 's losing a lung in there .
five o'clock .
why are you bothering them for ?
hello ? what ? yeah sure i 'll do it . i just had something cancelled the same weekend . ok . great . bye . you know life is amazing . i just lost a job and five minutes later get another same weekend same money .
then this pennsylvania dutch thing comes out of nowhere . i mean how am i supposed to respond to that ?
yeah when it 's your money it 's fascinating .
it 's like we 're living in the NUMs here .
no i got into a thing with the son and now he 's laid up too .
are n't you going to tell your parents you 're still alive ?
yeah ?
i ca n't believe this . my next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year . he even met with an executive at calvin klein . i ca n't believe they stole his idea .
hot out .
yeah is this sid fieldo s residence ?
fault . do you smell smoke ?
get outta here .
so he 's an eligible receiver .
there you go .
absolutely . you should not have to pay for that .
we 're not leaving the car .
oh wow .
am i supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it ? i mean if i could have seen it with her fine . but i ca n't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples availabilities at movies .
okay question #NUM . what if i told you my fiancee left me for another man ? does that make me more likable less likable as likable ? let 's start over here this time .
oh . my god .
my father has never thrown anything out . ever .
let 's get the check . is this uh considered signing ? do you do this when you want the check ?
i dunno
what 's the difference ?
well i think we 're going to need more than a hand . they have to see a human face .
no . no i ca n't .
i ca n't believe this . so what are you saying ? you did n't like my act so that 's it ?
i do n't think it 's that bad .
i 'm not the one doing the cooking newman .
ah no wonder we 're getting so much rain .
stop shouting . you 're ruining the reception .
a friend of a friend of susan 's .
w what do you mean ?
all right . font
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do i 'm selling that car .
i 'm looking . that 's the point . i like looking .
alright alright . just let me finish my coffee then we 'll watch em go slice this fat bastard up .
i ca n't . i 'm on my way out . there 's no way i can do it .
who would pay that much ?
oh . damn
minsk ?
is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen ?
no she thinks she 's in love with him . but she 's just remembering this old commercial .
i think we 're still a man short .
you were full . so you gave a reason . you did n't just shake your head .
remember mrs . hudwalker ? the ninety four year old woman who lived above me ?
oh . hey .
no . i know what i want .
take the keys .
ah it 's probably like smith over there .
you know you should just go back to the optical store and ask dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog .
i 'm not gay .
my act ? wha what does that have to do with anything ?
what happened ?
so then as i was getting out of the car
she likes him i mean she really likes him .
well then that 's it . that 's the end of that .
why would anyone eat canned fruit ? i mean can anybody answer that ?
i no i do n't want to go .
hey
you see i kept up my end of the pact .
not because you 're dirty not because you 're clean just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine
i did n't have a deal . they 're two hundred dollars a pop . what do i do ?
well you have insurance
this is outrageous . pack of juicy fruit .
hey the woman got you a job . the least you could do is buy her a gift . how about this ?
boy i bet you got a regular algonquin round table there .
are you ok in here ?
and what hope for a crash ?
well you 've come a long way .
i was in the men 's room the other day and they had the hand blower instead of the paper towels you know this thing . i like the hand blower i have to say . it takes a little bit longer but i feel when you 're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can .
well i was walking around naked in front of melissa the other day
NUM and george on the invitations
no no no no oh no .
yeah i know like yesterday i lost a job and then i got another one and then i missed a tv show and later on they re ran it . and then today i missed a train went outside and caught a bus . it never fails . i always even out .
that 's what willie loman told biff before his interview in death of a salesmang .
yes . i was using them to spit out the mutton .
newman kramer if you 'll indulge me . according to your story keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple . the spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking newman between the third and forth rib . the spit then cam off the rib turned and hit newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap . the spit then splashed off the wrist pauses in mid air mind you makes a left turn and lands on newman 's left thigh . that is one magic luggie .
who figures and immigrant 's going to have a pony ?
i 'll call george .
thanks it 's a breakaway .
no . so we 're still on to see uh firestorm tonight ?
what for ?
but you 're going over there for dinner tonight right ?
the wheels are in motion things are happening .

what do you think the dry cleaner 's is your own personal closet .
you do n't have to say wow . i know it 's wow . and there 's that smile again . well what is that ? it 's george .
well means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race he 's put his faith in you and frankly i 'm a little concerned .
yeah .
she would n't so much as taste it .
and what 's with people getting sick ?
you feel better ?
it was not .
i 'll have the ah turkey club without the bacon .
the type that does n't return phone calls . i knew we should n't have done this it was a bad idea in the first place i told you .

well you know i was thinking if things do n't exactly work out
okay okay . forget it . it 's okay . i did n't mean it .
ho ah . it 's it 's it 's kitschy .
well you know we were having dinner the other night and she 's got this strangest habit . she eats her peas one at a time . you 've never seen anything like it . it takes her an hour to finish them . i mean we 've had dinner other times . i 've seen her eat corn niblets . but she scooped them .
absolutely not . he sped up .
yes it is . soup and sandwich . that is a meal .
because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there 's a chance they might somehow kiss .

cause that 's what 's going to happen .
i i 'm not happy with what i wrote .
no .
yes it is .
that stinky old movie house ?
george .
it 's amazing how shopping makes me have to go . all i have to do is walk into a department store and it 's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in .
how you going to drive when looking through a periscope ? besides it 's not a submarine and there 's no room for a periscope in a car .
shake is bad but what if it 's the two hander ? the hand on the bottom the hand on the top the warm look in the eyes ?
this is weird wild stuff . george has n't even seen her yet .
they sealed him up with the mint inside .
you want to hang out here at phase two of the pines of mar gables ?
so what plans do you have ?
you know jeffery ?
yeah .
great .
he never heard of corduroy . true story true story .
lemme see if i understand this on second thought
goodnight . not just a good night a great night .
pam ? what about pam ?
you 're not cartwri
just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine .
no i 'm calling her .
how you going to pay ? you do n't even have a wallet .
by the way newman i 'm just curious . when you booked the hotel did you book it for the millennium new year ?
it 's been three days already forget about lupe .
it 's isosceles
i do n't have any change . you 've got any change ?
well something happens .
yeah me too .
hey kramer ?
uh huh what 's that ?
alright come on . who wants to watch the fight ?
yeah . every time i see her i got to kiss her hello . i just did it once on her birthday somehow it mushroomed . now i dread seeing her because of it .
what 's the matter ?
what is he like ?
untalented she 's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation . it 's really depressing .
oh all the way .
but this is what you 've always wanted .
we 're getting vasectomies .
well you implied it .
what ?
we 're talking federal crime here .
oh no just a custom . uh that 's my friend george . you look good .
ipecac ? kramer i really think you guys are going too far with this .
well kramer thought it would make her happy . i never should have cashed those checks .
well if they make squeeze mustard does n't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup ?
you do n't have a car .
they have gotten to know you .
now here 's another little rule .
it 's a letter from your friend barry prophet 's lawyer .
where 's kramer ?
i tell ya i do n't see it happening .
hey how ya doin ? y'know i got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line .
oh no .
well you 've only got another fifty years or so to go before it 'll all be over
i do n't know . they 've been in there since like world war ii . the rent 's three hundred a month .
the bad date the bad sport the bad citizen the bad tipper .
it does n't have to be someone who gets a lot of women . it could be just some guy with a big ass .
it 's like watching an animal get tortured .
robert .
no she 's not .
aah .
just like that ?
no no that 's not him . what happened to him ? i ca n't believe it . i lost him . that stupid idiot . now what are we going to do ?
well it 's a gift and i want you to keep it .
uugh . ahh .
no .
alright newman . this is it .
yeah .
oh no .
how 's it doing ?
uncle leo . what are you doing here ?
you did ? .
sorry really .
no .
are you sure ?
you 're engaged ?
pretty lucky to find this hotel jean paul .
yeah . i think i do .
look at the picture on this thing
koko ?
you 're thinking about it too much . you 're putting too much emphasis on it .
that 's strange
uhm see the key to eating a black and white cookie elaine is you want to get some black and some white in each bite . nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate . and yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us . if people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved .
i 'm sorry about the gift i did n't know about your condition .
i beg your pardon ? cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka . people love cinnamon . it should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper . anytime anyone says oh this is so good . what 's in it ? the answer invariably comes back cinnamon . cinnamon . again and again . lesser babka i think not .
oh uh nothing she just choked on a jujube
oh thanks .
right .
so how can you promise her ?
elaine
well you know what this means do n't you ?
yeah and then i asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah .
where 's george ?
maybe .
what happened to you ?
of course i was getting you a note .
well they 've got to be here somewhere .
he 's new around here .
no i have n't ?
answering machine . oh i hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls .
ah no i do n't think so .
i do n't even know where the bubble boy lives . i i do n't even remember the name of the town .
well at least you and i are okay again .
so how 's it going at work ? they get tired of it ?
yeah it 's all my father 's doing .
why did i think there was a rubber man ? there 's elastic man plastic man
no . i guess i just was n't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage .
yeah when he 's dead he 'll be relieved oh by the way viking press sent a fedex for you to my parents . they brought it with em .
yeah .
hi .
and then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride .
no spiel ?
you 're behind in the count .
oh yes he 's very proud of his work in the big game . so you 've never uh met him before ?
so what did tim say ? '
what he does n't like my taste in music ?
oh my god . yes you close with the swirl . there 's a progression there . i told you to write it down .
what are you talking about ? i bombed .
hey joe .

lyndon johnson used to do that to his staffers .
who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut ?
yeah .
alright that 's enough
thank you .
i there . this is kramer and frank .
that 's enough .
cheapness is not a sense .
uh laura george was wondering if
that old one ? did n't i once miss a flight to cleveland because of that alarm clock ?
no no . you ca n't get her anything better than me . whatever i spend you have to spend half .
ah it 's just a car .

oh well
i think we might have one left in the stock room .
it was a joke
well you should hear the message from my nut . where 's george and kramer i want to get inside already i do n't like standing out here i feel very vulnerable .
george if you could master this you 'll never be alone again .
hey look you know you 're the one who 's locked out . i 'm letting you stay here . you 're wearing my bathrobe . you should adapt to me .
oh yeah . he 'd hold national security meetings in there . he planned the hanoi bombing after a bad thai meal .
you see ? .

lannie how was the trip ?
i 'm going
hey there 's elaine .

well i do n't want to get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here but you know the sound a can makes when you open it ?
hey hey hey slow down eddie . what what 's the matter ?
i mean your body of work in this field is unparalleled .
nnnoo i do n't want em .

hey ? is rerunning the yankee game . you watching this ?
what causes homophobia ? what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry ? i think it 's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance . we 're constantly buying shoes that hurt us pants that do n't fit right . men think obviously i can be talked into anything . what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking it 's a shoe store and the salesman goes just hold this guy 's hand walk around the store a little bit see how you feel . no obligation no pressure just try it . would you like to see him in a sandal ?

kramer y'know guys like you with no conscience do n't know what it 's like for guys like me . i 'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people 's feelings .
yes .
yes you have n't read a page have you ?
hi elaine
i 'll give you NUM cents .
you got gonorrhea from a tractor ? and you call that your tractor story ?
in fact it 's the only racquet he plays with .

i sure do miss my apartment . maybe i 'll switch back . font
hi uncle leo .

no but in one point he did use the bathroom .
you told testikov that tolstoy wanted to name his book war what is it good for ? ?
there 's nothing subtle about that .
yes we do .
i got ripped off for about the NUM time ? and now the first couple a times you go through it it 's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say call the police . you really should call the police . so you think to yourself you know you watch tv you think yeah i 'm calling the police . stakeouts manhunts i 'm going to see some real action . right you think that . so the police come over to your house they fill out the report . they give you your copy . now unless they give the crook his copy i do n't really think we 're going to crack this case do you ? it 's not like batman where there 's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows who they are . very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore . it makes them a lot tougher to spot . did you lose a sony ? it could be the penguin . i think we can round him up he 's dressed like a penguin . we can find him he 's a penguin .
that 's funny because i have n't seen you working for a while . a long while .
maybe we should go .
yeah elaine 's going to do the same thing to puddy 's radio that the radio did to her .
no leo 's not there . he 's got a girlfriend lydia . in fact he moved in with her .

what 's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics .
best friend i 've never been to your apartment .
yeah ?
i woulda taken you to the airport .
so what do you have to say for yourself ?
two minutes . believe me i know his two minutes . by his conception of time his life will last over two thousand years .
what 's taking him so long out there ?
is n't that some kind of safety thing ?
oh my god .
i mean the whole thing it 's just
can i use your phone ?
alright . i just hope i can get it to the friars club before the show .
i better not .
elaine got a new number because she died .
what about the gentle cycle ? you ever use that ?
this is amazing i have n't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened . poor guy .
you ready for the second one ?
oh bruline . newman 's got the same one .
and if you 're ever in the city you know you want to come to a comedy club whatever .
sure just tell maura you 're having an affair .
okay how about this i 'm in my apartment you come in .
i could read the sports section if my hair was on fire .
would n't it be great if you could ask a woman what she 's thinking ?
what about bran ?
well what are we going to do now . if we ca n't get the babka the whole thing 's useless .
well how come ?
oh you 're tall she 's tall i 'm tall . what 's the difference who 's tall . we 're all tall .
come on up .
well it 's a new suede jacket . it might get ruined .
because if he catches us we 'll never be able to get soup again .
elaine how about this shirt ? is this okay ?
hey you do n't play with that . that 's going in my mouth .
well what about her ?
thank you no .
ya what was this ?

hey
really ?
oh you think she 's erika the phone sex woman
the buzzer .
i ca n't believe someone has n't killed her yet .
kramer you got to explain to her what happened .
or he 's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity . elaine you could be dating the green lantern .
you mean that ?
yeah .
really ?
her father wrote that .
hello ? oh hi mr . pitt .
i do n't know .
i know but it 's a very important wake up call and i do n't want to take any chances .
why will she still do it ? she hates you now . people do n't do you favors after you dump them .
yes this is the terrorist bomber .
oh i 'm stressed . font
no you stay here in the car .
he 's the busboy you think he cares about the soup ?
i mean i know it 's the wrong thing to do . she works in elaine 's office . i know it 's wrong but i ca n't get that hand off my leg . i mean i 'm looking at the hand and i 'm thinking that hand should not be on my leg . but i ca n't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words would you mind ? . '
hi how are ya ?
i 'd be happy to .
what you 're considering this ?
she might be . she 's the star of the show .

ah baking soda . annoying little product . i can do this . i can do that . why does n't this stuff just shut up ?
nah .
what 's that perfume you 're wearing ?
and the other .
you know what ? that was the amazing thing .
no . it is n't and the most distressing part of it is not that she went out with him but that he stopped seeing her . do you understand ? he newman newman stopped seeing her . newman never stopped seeing anybody . newman will see whoever is willing to see him . not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is . but why did he newman stop seeing her ?
um hum .
well i i ca n't believe this . i know phil he he 's a good friend of mine . we play softball together . how could this be ?
hey everybody . who 's ready to laugh ?
for what ?
they 're real cubans ? . they 're human beings from cuba ? .
you know i went out once with a nude model . never let me see her naked . hundreds of people see her naked every week except me . needless to say it was quite vexing .
oh come on .
i will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the NUM .
i suppose you think your bombable .
what ? . how ?
i 'll call him . hello ray ? hi ray this is rava 's friend elaine 's friend jerry the king of comedy right . listen you know that statue on your mantle the one with the blue lady ? would you shut up ? . yeah you do n't want to talk about it over the phone ? you do n't want rava to hear ? yeah i understand you know that coffee shop near my house monk 's ? all right tomorrow one o clock great okay bye .

elaine i do n't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand . i happen to love that soup .
well i 'm great .

hey any luck ? did you catch em ?
tractor .
i 'm heading over to elaine 's .

a few years ago the comedy club had a softball team . kramer was our first baseman you could n't get anything by him it was unbelievable . anyway this one game we came back to win from like NUM runs behind . so kramer says to richie why do n't you dump the bucket of gatorade on marty benson 's head ? the club owner . so richie goes ahead and does it .

george .

if only you could put your mind to something worthwhile . you 're like lex luthor .
the timeless art of seduction .
hello ?
i kinda like this opera crowd i feel tough anybody else got a problem ?
the whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal . you know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away . how extensive their vocabulary is . i would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary . i would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching quervo beach volleyball tournament . if you want to maintain the brainy mammal image .
kramer 's party .
the waiting room . i hate when they make you wait in the room . cause it says waiting room . there 's no chance of not waiting . cause they call it the waiting room they 're going to use it . they 've got it . it 's all set up for you to wait . and you sit there you know and you 've got your little magazine . you pretend you 're reading it but you 're really looking at the other people . you know you 're thinking about about them . things like i wonder what he 's got . as soon as she goes i 'm getting her magazine . and then they finally call you and it 's a very exciting moment . they finally call you and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room . well i guess i 've been chosen . i 'll see you all later . you know so you think you 're going to see the doctor but you 're not are you ? no . you 're going into the next waiting room the littler waiting room . but if they are you know doing some sort of medical thing to you you want to be in the smallest room that they have i think . you do n't wnat to be in the largest room that they have . you know what i mean ? you ever see these operating theaters that they have with like stadium seating ? you do n't want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go i have to see this . are you kidding ? are they really going to do that to him ? are there seats ? can we get in ? do they scalp tickets to these things ? i got two for the winslow tumor i got two
stuff .
yeah your widower story 's tested through the roof . when are you getting out of there ?
no . i pay her to clean . the rest is
we 'll always have pancakes .
i ca n't go if you 're mad .
no rejection no guilt no remorse .

you know that that thing about her being too good for him . i mean i was just being folksy . they could tell i was just being folksy ?
uh i 'm just selling some of dado s things that 's what he would have wanted .
ya and also i 'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me . you know they got nothing to lose what do they care ?
elaine can i just explain something to you very privately here ? susan and i have been together many many times now and just between you and me there 's really no big surprises here so make up sex is all that i have left .

you might want to try it makes the movie more enjoyable that 's all .
hey hey hey . what 's going on here ? you did n't agree to anything did ya ?
are you sure ?
so i 'm dressing and she 's staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events . i do n't know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all i do n't have the time to say it . the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman and i 'm very sorry i just saw the bat signal . it took me NUM days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again . now she 's waiting for me to call her and she 's
what about your stuff ?

not a plane crash . is it a plane crash ?
how can you just get it ?
oh you 're dead .

it 's a performance jerry . like what you do .
what 's so hard about that ? how am i supposed to get it in there ? i ca n't just walk in with it . i have to get the rosses out of the apartment .
well i think you should drop him down to step two .
drakes ?
it 's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring .
well actually i thought it up on the way over here .
hide hide under the desk .
good thing i asked
when i asked him if it was cancer he did n't give me a get outta here . that 's what i wanted to hear cancer ? get outta here ? '
i find it disorienting . who buys an umbrella anyway ? y you get em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans .
why do n't you call her agency . maybe she 's been out of town and she did n't get the calls .
ang wait 'll you see the dress that she 's got . it 's backless . uh ? . i 'm finally going to make a great entrance .

he asked me to keep it a secret .
do you want us to go with you ?

yes .
you got it .
he 's a jerk .
ah alright before that i was in real estate . i quit because the boss would n't let me use his private bathroom . that was it .
the thing that bothers me the most is the lying .
a guy ?
it 's only four
huh . you must think i 'm pretty stupid . that was no NUM avenue bar . i can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip . now that that that is a cookie and we all know that twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch .
you mean a blessing in disguise ?
i got your calzones mr . steinbrenner .
so in order to use these i got to spend like fifteen hundred bucks . this is a bill for fifteen hundred dollars . plus she 'd ask about the sleeping arrangements that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing .
look at where we are . he 's not stopping . he just keeps going and going and going . we 're not in the first row ?
at the funeral give or take . you know deep down i always kinda felt that they blamed me for susan 's death .
yeah yeah . you must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too .
do oh oh oh the judge . i hate this guy .
i think i 'd be good at that . i talk to people all the time . someone even told me once they thought i 'd be a good talk show host .
excuse me ?
yeah .
here 's the tv . i know you wanted to watch the super bowl . do you at least have some towels we could sit on ? it 's like a four hour game .
we do ?
we are really late now . we 're in big trouble . big trouble .

you are a genius it 's as simple as that .

live ?
i agreed to become his butler .
me too . and he 's dying jerry . if relationship george walks through this door he will kill independent george . a george divided against itself cannot stand .
i uh just think it 's a little unusual . two people to sit on one side and leave the other side empty .
so i started to walk into the water . i wo n't lie to you boys i was terrified . but i pressed on and as i made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me . i i do n't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but i tell you jerry at that moment i was a marine biologist .

i 'll get him to see a real doctor . you just stay away from this .

her back went out . she 's got to be there for a couple of days . all she said on the way over in the car was why george why ? . i said because it 's there .

it 's george .
well after dinner last week she invites me back to her apartment .
ahhh . how does this thing work ?
any money in it ?

welcome back .
did you feel that tension ? we use to have banter there 's no more banter .
oh i beg to differ . my father took great pride in his appearance he was a very handsome man a casanova really .
apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a toxic .
all right . so let me ask you a question . who was the man in the cape ?
yeah thank you .
where ?
what is that the one your parents gave you ?
oh my god .
looks like veal .
but i mean look at him . he 's got to be on his feet like that all day ? that 's brutal . i think i 'm going to say something to your uncle .
well it 's getting dark .
i told you i told you . ha ha ha . ooh ooh .
i just got fired .
uh yeah . hang on . just yeah .
why do n't you just commit yourself already ?
i mean she 's beautiful right ? she 's just my type . the dark hair the full lips .
i think i 'm getting tired of it . i mean is that all it does ? hello ? la la la ?
pst . wilkinson 's got a bite on a new one . petramco corp . out of uh springfield . i think . they 're about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher .
listen you go over to the ticket counter i 'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of time magazine . there 's supposed to ba blurb about jerry in it and i think he mentioned my name .
what 's with all the butter ?
an apartment complex the uh the eiffel towers . uumm like i said uh you 'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again i 'm sorry .

yes .
oh god .

maybe he 's resting .
i went to the beach .
you 're doing all the leg work .
late june .
i do n't know .
what is this ?
yeah .
think i 'm not ?
how did ya ?
well i 've given this a lot of thought and i 've got to say
you could pet them . they come right out of the water onto the sidewalks .
yes hello . party 's over .
hey hay . lloyd . hey . my friend jerry eh .
yup .
people who do that should be arrested .
i noticed you eh chose the eh clowns with balloons check design .
she 's been locked up for two years . she 's going to want to make up for lost time . dinners . movies . talking
you do n't know ?
jerry could you excuse us for a few minutes please ?
ade i have to tell you i i have never met anybody so efficient .
people smoke elaine . my mother smoked . it did n't hurt me .
yeah when the season starts . right now i sit around pretending that i 'm busy .
so uh how long has this been going on ?

she has n't seen the article . when she sees it she 's going to think i 'm out baby . i 'm out .
yes he 's a clown .
well danielle we should get going . i got a key made for you .
my cousin worked for bouchardo s . they used to use the bouilla base for a toilet .
i 'll have the tuna .
nucleosis .
now see here doctor .
i am never saying i love you again unless they say it first .
seemingly . seemingly to the untrained eye i can fully understand how you got that impression . what looked like pushing what looked like knocking down was a safety precaution . in a fire you stay close to the ground am i right ? and when i ran out that door i was not leaving anyone behind . oh quite the contrary . i risked my life making sure that exit was clear . any other questions ?
they say this guy 's the best .
not really . your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch .
alright but no later because my parents are coming back .
medium turkey chili .
well they hurt him bad . really hurt his feelings . it 's a long story . i i do n't like to talk about it but i swore then that i would never work for big broker houses . see all they care about is money . i 'm about more than money i 'm about people always gone my own way and i 've never looked back .
ava was one of the reasons i used to like going to work she was a friend . now we sleep together and suddenly i do n't know how to talk to her . every time i go to the bathroom i pass her desk . i have to plan little patter . i spend half my day writing . then afterwards i sit in my office and analyze how it went . if it was a good conversation i do n't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day . i see her laughing and talking with other people they 're all so loose and relaxed i think that used to be me . i want to go back there again . '
so anyway if you think about it manure is not really that bad a word . i mean it 's newer' which is good and a ma in front of it which is also good . ma newer right ?

it 's huge .
yeah they made me sick .

you got to look at this . i pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me .
just go back . pretend the whole thing never happened .
ready ?
hey hey .

good thinking .
well i wish i could say the same but i must say with all due respect i find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization . in the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of new york a good deal of distress as we have watched you take our beloved yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock all for the glorification of your massive ego .
what ?
yeah i better grab some too .
i have to talk to elaine . this cleaing lady is turning the screws on me . she 's pushing for this whole relationship thing . she keeps calling me threatening to go to the boss with this thing i could lose my job i got to do something to keep her quiet .
i just talked to mr . kruger he 'll be down in a minute . he wanted me to take a photograph for the record .
ha ha ha ha oh all right go ahead deride deride if you must . but let me tell you something with my personality and this set of hair you know what i am now ? i am in the game . i no longer defer to the coifed . i 'm a player .
are you kidding ? i lie every second of the day . my whole life is a sham .
shut up ?
and she 'll still see it you 're not stopping her from seeing it .
this is a crude mock up of the conference room . NUM scale .
newww tuxedo . for the pinstripe ball . steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at tavern on the green heh .

oh you want to taste mine .
i mean we can put a man on the moon but we 're still basically very stupid . the guy who 's car this is ? he could be one of the guys that built the rocket . you see what i 'm saying ?
when you 're playing the piano do you think about me ?
well i think this is it .
yeah yeah .
NUM NUM p . m . do you need any money ?
did you tell her anything ?
no lindsay it was not in the garbage . it was above the garbage . hovering . like an angel . of course i know your aunt bit it . i kissed her goodbye . listen can i tell you something else ? in my family we used to eat out of the garbage all the time . it was no big thing . that 's right . oh okay . buh bye . i 'm back in she gave me a second chance .
i say fourteen o nine .
no no no . nothing happens .
so i 've got ice cream all over my face . there were no napkins there . whoever it was that 's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship .
maybe i 'll get her some jewelry .

you know what this means ? i ca n't see her anymore either .
oh no . no stories .

so they knew ? those liars .
pull it up a little bit .

yada .
dollar eighty nine . why is this a dollar eighty nine ? why is there no haggling in this country ? font
i mean how funny is this ?

i know . this was the only woman i never lied to . well that 's not entirely true .
yeah you 're just so hip .
ha harrr . '
what are we going to do ? how are we going to get out of here ?
yeah like i 'm going to risk my job with the new york yankees to make a few extra bucks .
i 'm not really sure i
keith called you ?
you said the guy gave you an open lipped kiss .
well that 's the gist of it .
have you ever had their egg salad ?
five thousand ten . ten thousand . five thousand .
and this is kramer .
sorry you do n't know what 's going on out there . who 's he ?
heh haa . and that 's no good . i 've tried it straight jerry . we 've all seen the results . for me sick is the only way to go .
we could build a cabin like that .
it 's baffling is n't it ?
oh yes . i i 'm your baby bluey .
yodel lay hee hoo
the woman we bought the wheelchair for ?
perhaps . i walk in everything is organized messages appointments . and i ca n't tell you how proud i am of myself for going with ade .
yeah right .
i got to call her . should i call her ?
you really think so ?
oh so now i have to buy this whole chair by myself ?
like this .
yeah the neck hole thing and i would appreciate it if you would say you 're sorry .
yes i look forward to many years of looking at the triangles . well i 'll ah i 'll wait for you outside .
but after that we really talked did n't we ?
well it 's this little place with this little bathroom . it 's like right there you know it 's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove . you understand ? there 's no buffer zone . so we start to fool around and it 's the first time and it 's early in the going . and i begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm . so i know i 'm going to have to stop . and as this is happening i 'm thinking even if i can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force i know that that bathroom is not going to provide me with the privacy that i know i 'm going to need
i think he was impressed .
so now the father is screaming at me he 's demanding that i pay for the boom box . finally i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there .
well thank you for your support .
hurry up .
it 's ok .
well you know if you were sitting right next to her you 'd have to console her no matter what .
wait a minute wait a minute do you think i ? m comfortable here . i ca n't change i ? ve got no clothes here . you 've got to go like that i can ? t go like this alone .
do we have to ?
wax museum .

all i know is i 've been going to doctors all my life . what has it gotten me ? i 'm thirty three years old . i have n't outgrown the problems of puberty i 'm already facing the problems of old age . i completely skipped healthy adulthood . i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever . you could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm . i 've never had a normal medium orgasm .
hunh you know it 's the damnedest thing . i went out the window again to to get a cup of coffee

what ? that ? s why i came all the way over here .
i think they went out to dinner .
oh how would he know . he blacked out . he fainted .
well he said he 'd drive me here right after . so i am sitting in his car twenty minutes . he does n't come down . i am freezing . then a cop comes by tells me to get out of the car . he 's a city marshal . he 's towing the car away . kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets . he was going to tow it with me in the car . so they tow the car . now i am standing outside and i am freezing but i cannot leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car . so finally he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves . he said he was getting special instructions that each dove has a different diet so we 're wandering around trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out . now we 're running down the street after these doves i almost got hit by a bus . so how 's everything going over here ?
would you please ? .
uhh .
so i told him hit the road . i 'm going back with jack . '
i 'm sure you 'll have another fight george . hold that thought .

it can be very frustrating .
really ? what is it about ?
todd .
do n't worry tim . i did n't come by to yell at you i did n't come by for that at all . i just came by to pick up my label maker . i gave you a label maker and now i would like to have it back .

uhh . what are you doing ?
cause then i could move in here .
george ?
jerry .
he reads everything you know nedo s very well read .
not so good .
well . uh . i do n't know about sick . i mean maybe it was somebody who did n't want to talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit chat ang was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling did n't want to speak to them ah .
we just tease some one til they develop an eating disorder . guy who ruined his life .
i ca n't . he 's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight . i do n't want to upset him . aw what the hell i 'll upset him .
what 's to discuss ?
ha . that 's preposterous .
because i got popcorn too and i ate that first .
it 's ok .
take a guess .
why did you get a maid ?
no .
why ? why did you get into a fist fight with the cop ? you were innocent .
adam you do n't become a man overnight . look at your father . it takes time . patience experience . uh several careers of varying success . and these are things i look for in a man .
what ?
no no no this is just cranberry juice .
i had to take it again .
well they 're perfectly edible .
are you sure ?
you know joel and i have an extra ticket to the giants game .

that 's my coat . gimme that . where did you get that ?
why are you so concerned about this ?
i just finished working out are you busy ?
oh like any man would ever look at me come on i ? m going to get out of here .
mr . pitt i have something to tell you .
i had no idea you had this kind of money .
oh this is nuts . i ca n't get across anywhere .
what is wrong with this book ?

it was weird because george and i get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one on one .
oh yeah . yeah . i love nudist colonies . they help me unwind . aah .
okay so fine . go .
i did n't talk to anyone i was just walking by and i saw the sign and i thought george might get a kick out of it .
is that ?
she 's a physical therapist . she does n't want to have to deal with that outside of the office .
would n't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth ?
oh my god .
hey what do you think of this ?
i eh i got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer .
you know maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre .
oh .
uh that does n't make any sense . i am leaving .

he tells him which soap to use .
well i do n't know . i may never marry . it might be the closest i get .

hey .
i hope carlitto feels better . ben really wishes he couldo ve helped .
tell me if you think this is strange . there 's this guy who lives in my building who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend . he 's a uh teacher or something . anyway after we met whenever we 'd run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little . nothing much . little pleasantries . he 's a nice guy he 's got a family . then after a while i noticed there was not more stopping . just saying hello and continuing on our way . and then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition . so fine . i figure that 's where this relationship is finally going to settle polite nodding . then one day he does n't nod . like i do n't exist ? . he went from nods to nothing .
ok thanks so much . what are you all dressed up for ?
well i bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work . the way you worked on my filling you were so so gentle and so caring and so sensitive .
