you see i come up with these things i know they 're gold but nothing happens . you know why ?
no no time . it 's all this meaningless time . laundry grocery shopping coming in here talking to you . do you have any idea how much time i waste in this apartment ?

yeah that 's jerry you do n't have to worry about him . why do n't you go across the hall and get started on that mail .
he 's a go getter .
my intern from nyu . well you remember my corporation kramerica industries .
well apparently nyu is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience .
well this will really free up my time so i can focus on more important things like my bladder system .
jerry it 's not for people it 's for oil tankers .
you see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes the oil wo n't spill out .
yeah .
yeah NUM .
what ? when did this happen ?
darren .
sorry i could n't get out of there what did i miss ?
uh huh
boysenberry the kid is still learning .

dean jones you wanting to talk to me ?
yeah .
i know it sounds pretty glamorous but it 's business as usual at kramerica .
and with darren 's help we 'll get that chicken .
well i have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary .
i do n't know . i found them in your closet . ever since darren left i have n't been able to find anything . he took all my clothes to some cleaners . i 'm clueless . is that clock right ?
i was supposed to pick up newman at the zoo twelve hours ago .
jerry buddy i got to tell you something . that voice is played .
so played .
darren ? what are you doing here ? the college canceled the internship .
kramerica is no more .

hey .
it 's a tank of oil . darren and i are finally going to test out my bladder system .
no . no . no . it 's for oil tankers . all i need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact .
conceivably .
did you bring the video camera ?
you gave up the voice ?
whew . you know darren if you would have told me twenty five years ago that some day i 'd be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems i wouldo ve said you 're crazy now let 's push this giant ball of oil out the window .
bombs away .
well that did n't work . hey how about this ketchup and mustard in the same bottle ?

there you go .
ahh
jerry you forgot your purse .
hey silvio look at jerry here prancing around in his coat with his purse . yup he 's a dandy . he 's a real fancy boy .

it 's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . no one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change .
oh . yeah your old college roommate huh ?
hmmm dramatica comedia heh .

you know what woman i always thought you looked like leena horne .
and you must look exactly like jerry . you do n't see this you 're like twins wooooohhhhh . this is eerie .
c 'mon george relax . just because they look alike does n't mean you 're secretly in love with jerry .
yeah she 's a nice girl kinda quiet though .
well how should i have broached the subject'
well sounds like someone 's having a bad day .
well i think one of us should leave .
i 've made an important life decision .
aw right . i know i 've been shooting off at the mouth lately first with that girl whose life you destroyed and emm about george dating a lady jerry
i know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that 's exactly what i 'm going to do . i 'm never going to talk again .
what do i need to talk for ha . for to blab to the neighbors about george has a new fem jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho george is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend . see now i 've done all that now it 's time for silence .
jerry ninety four percent of communications is non verbal . here watch .
well it 's frank and estelle 's reaction of hearing george 's man love towards she jerry .
that 's the idea .
weeeeeepp .
that 's right aye oooh . right now .
ouch . now .
now you got to shut up . i 'm sorry i i have n't spoken in days .
all right starting now
hey . it happened again . another robbery in the building .
no it 's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables .
some taxidermy that 's been in my family for generations my tony my military discharge .
y b briefly . now i got to find a good place to hide this key . because if somebody finds this they hold the key to all my possessions .
literally ? what 's that supposed to mean ? you mind if i hide this somewhere ?
a little privacy uh ?
come on jerry this is a security issue . boy you would n't last a day in the army .
well that 's classified .

you just had to go looking for it did n't you ? see you hate it that i have a little secret . anything i do oooh oooh . you got to know all about it . you 're so obsessed with me .
oo y what are you doing with her ?
security issue .
that was n't me .
ok .

heyyyy .
heh .
it 's phil 's .
our neighbor that you turned against . anyway i told him it 'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway .
because since you 've been playing god with the front door i 've been trying to smooth things out jerry . in fact i was just hanging out at his place .
well i do n't know but the key problem is solved . i hid it at phil 's
no he does n't know . see i hid it without telling him . so uh phil wo n't be compulsively looking for it like some people you .
whoo . boy . yeah you clean up nice .
yeah see ? i knew you would lose em . that 's why i took em out of your dresser drawer and put em in my strongbox .
yeah we 'll stop by phil 's we 'll pick up the key uh ?

what ?
well fredo was weak and stupid . he should n't have eaten that key .
you just answered your own question .

the haunting memories of lost love . may i ? lights ? our eyes met across the crowded hat store . i a customer and she a coquettish haberdasher . oh i pursued and she withdrew then she pursued and i withdrew and so we danced . i burned for her much like the burning during urination that i would experience soon afterwards .

yeah yeah
what ?
i wish you never mentioned it to me .
ya know i hate to brag but uh i did win eleven straight golden gloves .
i would n't have brought it up but since you mentioned it .
well i won them anyway .
elaine . you do n't know the first thing about first base .
the way i figure it i 've already been there and i plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock .
funny .
what 's that ?
yeah .
is that a problem ?
he 's got money . why does n't he just pay a mover ?
hello .
oh you do n't remember me .
yeah you should . i certainly remember you . let me refresh your memory .
ah you remember .

c 'mon .
i 'll tell you how much i make .
you ever seen michael jordan ?
maybe you 'll see him do one of those three sixty dunks .
oh it 's like this here you guard me .
yeah .
so what 's going on how did all this happen ?
limo ? i thought that george went to pick him up .
well then why would they take a limo from the airport ?
that 's pretty strange . did he say anything else ?
o'brien . why would he want to be called o'brien ?
something 's very strange . george goes to the airport to pick up jerry . they come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and want to be called o'brien and murphy ? o'brien . o'brien why o'brien ?
who ?
i 'm telling you something 's going on . i can feel it sense it .
oh no no no this is no joke . o'brien 's coming in from chicago jerry 's in a limo says he 's o'brien ? that 's not funny . oh my god . yes . yes .
do n't you see ? there 's always been something very strange about jerry always so clean and organized . do i have to spell it out for you ? the limo ? the name ? the rally at madison square garden ? jerry o'brien are the same person . jerry is the leader of the aryan union .
i ca n't believe i did n't see it .
you do n't think so .
maybe he 's with the company .
the cia . maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within .
that 's the perfect cover . all that time on the road ? look jerry he 's too normal to be a comedian . these comedians they 're sick neurotic people .
what about him he 's part of it . his whole personality is a disguise . no real person can act the way he does . elaine i 'm telling you they 're with the organization . they 're all part of it . he 's in there with helms and hunt and liddy that whole crowd . george and jerry they probably know who killed kennedy .
alright what are we going to do ? i 'm not going to let him hurt you . i 'm not going to .
o'brien .
o'brien . long time no see . how 's tricks murphy ?
yeah ? eva ?
o'brien ? well that 's weird .
hey .
what ? what ? what ? tell me .
good for you . what kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that ? you know those people you know they 're mentally disturbed .
they should be sent to australia .
yeah yeah that 's where england used to send their convicts .
no .
yeah ?
i do n't know .
you know i was watching entertainment tonight and uh suddenly i got dizzy . and the next thing i know i hit my head on the coffee table .
yep .
maybe it was a reaction to the sardines .
what happened ? .
i think i hit my head again .
yeah .
what ?
mary hart .
hey you know who owns that car ?
the one that was hit a couple of nights ago .
that blond across the street . you know the one with the long ponytail she wears those blue sweatpants .
wait wait wait how do you know it 's not john tesh ?
how could you ?
man . i never thought you were capable of this .
i just talked to becky gelke outside she told me how you hit and ran .
i do n't even want to look at you anymore . all these years of friendship and you 're nothing but a felon . you 're an embarrassment to the building .
now you 're not going to lie to me are you ?
alright . well . glad we got that straightened out because i 've got a date with her .
yeah going out with her saturday night .
as a matter of fact if it was n't for you i would n't have even had an excuse to talk to her .
you sure you do n't want me to take my clothes off ? i 'll do it .
well why do n't you take your clothes off ?
well it 'd be our little secret .
are you getting the eyes ? cause they 're brown . or really they 're dark brown like rich columbian coffee .
she and jerry were a big thing like abe lincoln and mary todd .
oh yeah they 're like this .
why what 's the difference ?
well you know i uh have many relationships .
yeah .
george you going to buy a painting ?
yeah .

that 's right .
yeah . yeah i think it would be for the best .

heyahhh .
ya i did n't know you could cook .
well i knew you 'd regret it for the rest of your life .
wonder what 's going on .
hey . buddy it 's all happening .
the coffee table book . it 's a go oo .
you know what this means ? i 'm starting the book tour . first stop regis and kathy lee .
oh you better believe it .
no no no .
well coffee tables .
you know who you are ? even steven
yeah well ah i 'll tell you uh regis actually this is a true story . i umm i was skiing at the time .
yeah well now you kids do n't go out and try that . you stay in school .
you see the beauty of my book is if you do n't have a coffee table it turns into a coffee table .
that 's true . that 's right .
oh it 's on file right here .
hey boss .
how 're you doing there big guy ?
al righty have you got yourself a cold ?
woah that 's quite a honk .
get yourself some vitamin c with rose hips and bioflavenoids .
ya that was pretty good huh ?
because of the coffee thing ?
what about sonia live ? now you 're not cancelling sonia live ?
she 's a doctor i got a thing for her .
oh it 's true .
yeah you knew he had a cold . how 'd you expect him to blow his nose ? yea .
wait wait wait that 's too much . mine was more than yours .
nothin . '
what state ?
they 're never in contention .
because i 've seen every miss america pageant since i was six .
giddy up .
so what do you think ? does this work ?
no way .
look if you think i 'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman you 're crazy .
that 's right because i 'm going to see it does n't happen . look jerry these girls are miss america contestants . it 's every little girl 's dream . and i 'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for .
aaah . no buts . those are my rules .
now if you want to go out and have some good wholesome fun with a nice girl i 'd be glad to help you out if you 're looking for something more than that you 've got the wrong guy buddy .
if you were miss america what would you do to make the world a better place ?
what advice would you give young people ?
this is important stuff . she 's got to be able to answer these questions . she 's not going to have time to think out there with millions of people watching her . any hesitation could cost her the crown . you know poise counts .
oh yeah like last year ? miss texas ? now she should have won easily but she lost points in the swimsuit competition .
tape her breasts together .
well take you for example . now you 're very attractive but you got a big waist .
well i 'd recommend a waist cincher .
oh yeah . just thip . suck you in .
so what 's your talent ?
mmm . i 'm thinking of a number from one to ten .
no five . but you were close .
how 's your evening ?
stop right there .
disaster .
well you got brown eyes . you want to wear a green dress .
okay . but if i 'm going to do this we play by my rules or we do n't play at all .
hey .
oh come on .
oh you 're poo pooing .
well let me tell you something . i 'm taking this kid to the top . to the top jerry . we 're going for the crown and you ca n't stop her .
you ca n't stop her jerry . oh i 've seen em come and go but this kid has got something .
no . alright watch me now . turn back head up shoulders back posture . you see ? posture .
let 's try a few more questions alright ? if you were miss america and the u . s . was on the brink of a nuclear war and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy 's leader what would you do ?
yes they 're important . if you stumble if you hesitate you can kiss the crown goodbye . now if i 've told you once i 've told you a thousand times poise counts . it 's just as important as the others . swimsuit . evening wear . talent . poise .
what is it ?
how did this happen ?
well how did this happen ?
accident ? this was no accident . these doves were murdered .
well that 's it . she 's out of the pageant .
her birds are dead .
yeah birds . she 's got these trained doves she does this magic act that was her talent for the pageant . you know what i think jerry ? i think somebody murdered those doves . somebody wanted her out of that contest bad . somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy . somebody who just could n't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them .
you killed them did n't you ?
well do n't think you 've won because you have n't . this kid is a fighter . and if you think i 'm going to let a couple of dead birds get in our way you 're crazy .
how ya feelin ?
there 's nothing to be nervous about .
poise . poise .
that gendason what a jerk . i 'm never playing golf with him again .
steve gendason .
well i met him on the course a couple of years ago . yeah . played with him a lot . but today was it . we 're on the fifteenth hole ya he 's beating me by a couple of strokes . then he 's about to hit his second shot when he picks up the ball and cleans it .
umph sorry . but the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it 's on the green . the rules are very clear about that .
ya so i penalized him a stroke .
he lost it . we almost came to blows . we were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
a rule is a rule . and let 's face it . without rules there 's chaos .
turn on the tv .
i 'm puttin it on
jerry . . .
yeah but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner .
jerry jerry they found a tee .
a golf tee . in the dry cleaner .
listen to this if a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke . that 's a rule jerry .
because that 's the way i weas raised . you know when i was growing up i had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock . and if i was n't well i do n't have to tell you what happened .
you know he talked about pinkus on the course ?
oh yeah he said he brought a pair of pants into pinkus and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid . and pinkus denied responsibility . you see he was very upset with pinkus .
yeah but maybe i pushed him over the edge .
poor pinkus poor little pinkus .
oh i love curls .
all right i 'll see you later .
genderson 's .
it 's weighing on my conscience .
yeah this is kramer . i got genderson in the car . he wants to see his fish . i 'm taking him to see his fish . so tell the police to back off .
my name is kramer . you know who i am dammit .
i thought we would blend in .

but you got a whole pile here . NUM ?
jerry your grandmother gave you this gift . she wants you to spend the money to have the fun that she ca n't have . oh this is tantamount to a slap in the face .
jerry a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that does n't blossom .
